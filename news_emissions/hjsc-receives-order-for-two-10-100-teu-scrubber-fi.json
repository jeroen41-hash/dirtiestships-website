    "title": "HJSC receives order for two 10,100 TEU scrubber-fitted container ships",
    "summary": "HJSC will build two 10,100-TEU container ships fitted with scrubbers, likely continuing the use of heavy fuel oil (HFO). Scrubbers do not reduce CO2 emissions, so the \"eco-friendly\" label is misleading. It remains to be seen if these ships can achieve a competitive CII rating and avoid FuelEU Maritime penalties.",
    "content": "HJ Shipbuilding & Construction (HJSC) has signed a contract with a European shipowner to build two 10,100-TEU eco-friendly container ships, with options for two more.\n\nThe vessels will be constructed at the company\u2019s 90-year-old Yeongdo Shipyard, marking the first time the yard will produce container ships exceeding 10,000 TEU. As informed, the newbuilds feature advanced hull designs, optimized forms for maximum operational efficiency, and scrubber systems to meet International Maritime Organization (IMO) environmental standards.\n\nThe order is a milestone for Yeongdo Shipyard, which has steadily expanded its technical capabilities. In 2004, HJSC pioneered an innovative \u201cDAM technique\u201d to extend its 300-meter dock and build a 325-meter, 8,000-TEU vessel.\n\nThrough continuous innovation and engineering breakthroughs, we have overcome physical limitations and are now able to build container ships exceeding 10,000 TEU at Yeongdo Shipyard\n\n\u2026 said CEO Yoo Sang-cheol.",
