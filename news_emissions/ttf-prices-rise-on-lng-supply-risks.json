    "summary": "LNG prices are up 3% to \u20ac32.9 per MWh amid US-Iran tensions threatening Strait of Hormuz LNG shipments. This disruption could impact 20% of global LNG supply. Reduced EU gas storage, now at 32.5%, exacerbates the supply vulnerability.",
    "content": "European natural gas futures rose 3% to \u20ac32.9 per megawatt-hour, extending a 6.9% gain from the previous session, as fears grow that escalating tensions between United States and Iran could disrupt LNG flows through key Middle East routes.\n\nMarkets are focused on shipments via the Strait of Hormuz, a route for about 20% of global LNG, including exports from Qatar, the second largest exporter.\n\nA report from Axios said US military action against Iran could come sooner than expected, with Israel pushing for regime change, raising risks to regional supply.\n\nTight EU inventories add support, with European Union storage near 32.5%, the lowest since 2022, and Germany below 23%.",
