    "title": "Fragmented Carbon Schemes Threaten Maritime Progress, Warns BAR Technologies",
    "summary": "BAR Technologies bemoans the growing complexity of emissions compliance due to overlapping regional schemes like EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime. This fragmentation inflates costs and distracts from real decarbonisation investments. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) further complicates matters by pricing embedded emissions in seaborne cargoes.",
    "content": "BAR Technologies is urging immediate action toward a unified global carbon framework, warning that the proliferation of regional emissions trading schemes is placing unprecedented compliance pressure on the maritime sector and risks delaying progress on decarbonisation.\n\nWith multiple overlapping schemes now in effect or emerging, including the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, the IMO\u2019s postponed Net-Zero Framework, and proposed Greenhouse gas Fuel Intensity (GFI) measures, shipowners are increasingly navigating a maze of conflicting obligations. According to the International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP), over 30 emissions trading systems are now either in force or under development worldwide. This pattern of fragmentation reflects a broader global challenge: recent research from the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics identified over 900 climate adaptation laws and policies adopted across 35 countries since the Paris Agreement. While this surge signals growing ambition, it also highlights the risks of uncoordinated frameworks that lead to implementation gaps, increased costs and regulatory friction across borders.\n\n\u201cCarbon compliance is becoming more fragmented by the month,\u201d said John Cooper, CEO of BAR Technologies. \u201cInstead of building momentum behind a single global framework, we\u2019re creating a patchwork of schemes with different baselines, rules and cost mechanisms. That creates confusion, inflates costs, and weakens the industry\u2019s ability to invest in real, scalable solutions.\u201d\n\nThe situation is further complicated by mechanisms such as the EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which went live on 1 January 2026. While not directly taxing shipping emissions, CBAM introduces indirect carbon costs into the trade system by pricing the embedded emissions of goods such as steel, aluminium, cement, and fertilisers, all of which are major seaborne cargoes.\n\n\u201cCBAM is an example of how carbon pricing is now embedded into trade,\u201d Cooper noted. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a reminder that without multilateral alignment, we risk policy friction and commercial uncertainty on a global scale.\u201d\n\nTo avoid paralysis through bureaucracy, BAR Technologies is calling for a single carbon policy, one that is globally agreed, fairly administered and financially transparent. The company continues to advocate for a bunker-level collection mechanism to fund climate-positive reinvestment, while avoiding the duplication and complexity of overlapping schemes.\n\n\u201cWhile we await consensus on a unified framework, we cannot afford inaction,\u201d Cooper continued. \u201cWe need technologies that work today, across regulatory zones and wind propulsion is leading that charge.\u201d\n\nBAR Technologies\u2019 WindWings\u00ae, already deployed on multiple vessels, offer immediate fuel savings and emissions reductions. Beyond near-term impact, they enhance the viability of alternative fuels like methanol and ammonia by reducing overall fuel demand.\n\n\u201cWind doesn\u2019t need permission,\u201d said Lauren Eatwell, Head of WindWings\u00ae at BAR Technologies. \u201cIt\u2019s scalable, proven, and will be around forever. The industry has an opportunity to act now and lead, not wait to be regulated into action.\u201d",
