    "content": "Ahead of next month\u2019s meeting of the International Maritime Organization\u2019s (IMO) Pollution Prevention and Response committee (PPR 13, February 9-13), the Clean Arctic Alliance is calling on Canada, Iceland and Norway to demonstrate solidarity with Denmark and Greenland\u2019s leadership by supporting a proposal to reduce black carbon emissions from international shipping in the Arctic.\n\nJoin today\u2019s pre-PPR13 briefing on Zoom with the Clean Arctic Alliance: Black carbon, Scrubbers, Sewage and the Arctic\n\nDenmark, which represents Greenland at the International Maritime Organization, is proposing, along with France, Germany and the Solomon Islands a new mandatory measure on \u201cpolar fuels\u201d, PPR 13-6, which would require that only cleaner fuels with low emissions of black carbon be used by ships sailing in the Arctic.\n\n\u201cAs Arctic leaders, Canada, Iceland and Norway must show their support for an Arctic fuel proposal which sets out the characteristics of fuels that would be considered suitable for use in the Arctic \u2013 so-called polar fuels \u2013 at the IMO in February\u201d, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance. \u201cThis is a chance for democratic Arctic coastal nations of the north Atlantic to show their leadership and green credentials by supporting one another in the efforts to clean-up air polluting emissions from international shipping.\u201d\n\nSupport from Canada, Iceland and Norway is essential to follow up on the adoption of two emission control areas (in the Canadian Arctic and the Norwegian Sea), and approval of a further Northeast Atlantic emission control area (ECA)which is due to be adopted in 2026 and includes Iceland and Greenland\u2019s waters. While the ECAs are important in terms of reducing SOx and NOx air pollution, they do not adequately reduce emissions of superpollutant black carbon which poses both a health and a climate risk in the Arctic.\u201d\n\nLast October, the Nordic Council recommended that Nordic Governments take action to require that theses cleaner \u201cpolar\u201d fuels be used in the Arctic, but so far, Denmark and Greenland are the only Nordic nations to co-sponsor the proposal for an Arctic fuel measure.\n\nCanada\n\nThe Nordic Council Recommendation does not address Canada, but as an Arctic nation, Canada\u2019s support is equally necessary to reduce air pollution and the impact of Black Carbon on sea ice.\n\n\u201cCanada has supported the need for regulating Black Carbon from shipping for many years at the IMO, and also in domestic climate and air pollution strategies\u201d, said Andrew Dumbrille, Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance and Director of Equal Routes, a Clean Arctic Alliance member. \u201cPPR 13 is a prime opportunity to put this into action. For the first time a globally binding measure can be developed which will clean the air for Indigenous and local communities, contribute to maintaining ice habitat for wildlife, safeguard harvest rights key for local food sovereignty, and urgently address the climate crisis in the Arctic.\u201d\n\nIceland\n\nIn recent weeks, months and years, Iceland has repeatedly declared its support for Greenland\u2019s rights for full sovereignty; rights which are threatened by the rapid loss of ice and glaciers in the Arctic.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that Iceland support this proposal from Denmark, Greenland and others which with a wide scope can improve air quality in Iceland\u2019s waters and reduce black carbon emissions originating within Iceland\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) from settling onto sea- and land-ice in the Arctic \u2013 this pollution is speeding up melting, which in turn is contributing to the slowing down of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\u201d, said Arni Finnsson, Board Chair at the Iceland Nature Conservation Association.\n\nNote: Iceland deems possible Atlantic current collapse a security risk (Reuters)\n\nNorway\n\n\u201cNorway has already introduced an Emission Control Area in the Norwegian Sea which will take effect from 1 March 2027, and has supported the adoption of the Nordic Council Recommendation on action by Nordic Governments on the use of polar fuels in the Arctic\u201d, said Karoline Andaur, CEO of WWF Norway (WWF Verdens naturfond). \u201cNorway should support the proposal from Denmark, Greenland and others which with a wide scope can improve air quality in Norwegian waters, reduce black carbon emissions originating within Norway\u2019s EEZ settling onto sea- and land-ice in the Arctic, and reduce the threat of heavy fuel oil spills.\u201d\n\nSource: Clean Arctic Alliance",
