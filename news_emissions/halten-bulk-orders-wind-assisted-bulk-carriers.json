    "title": "Halten Bulk orders wind-assisted bulk carriers",
    "summary": "Halten Bulk's new 7,100-tonne deadweight ships will likely reduce fuel consumption, but wind-assisted propulsion alone rarely achieves substantial carbon intensity improvements. The Baltic and North Sea are already subject to stringent sulphur emission controls, so the impact of these ships may be limited. We will monitor their carbon intensity to ensure compliance and report any FuelEU Maritime violations.",
    "content": "Norwegian shipping company Halten Bulk has placed an order for two 7,100 DWT self-dischargingbulk carriers equipped with rotor sails.\n\nA self-discharging bulk carrier is a bulk cargo vessel fitted with onboard conveyor and boom systems that unload cargo without shore-based equipment.\n\nThe ships will be built in China by Jiangsu SOHO Marine Heavy Industry, based on a design from Norwegian Ship Design Company.\n\nOnce delivered, they will operate along the Norwegian coast, as well as across the North Sea, the wider Nordic region and the Baltic.",
