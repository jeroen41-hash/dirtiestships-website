    "summary": "Great Lakes Maritime Academy attracts Louisiana cadets seeking maritime careers. Graduates often pilot vessels on the Mississippi River or operate offshore supply ships. The academy encourages graduates to remain in the Great Lakes region, despite Louisiana's proximity to Gulf shipping lanes.",
    "content": "TRAVERSE CITY \u2014 The Great Lakes Maritime Academy (GLMA) at Northwestern Michigan College is drawing cadets from an unlikely place. It\u2019s gained a reputation in the \u201cBayou State\u201d as the place to go if you want to pilot or work on ships.\n\nEvery year, GLMA admits up to 60 cadets. Many of them make the more than 1,200-mile trip all the way from Louisiana to spend four years honing their skills on the Great Lakes.\n\n\u201cWell, in a way, it\u2019s an honor because there are seven federally regulated maritime academies. You\u2019ve got the federal academy and six state academies, and there\u2019s one in Galveston, which is a lot closer to New Orleans than Traverse City,\u201d said Great Lakes Maritime Academy Superintendent, Rear Admiral Jerry Achenbach. \u201cI\u2019m going to guess probably, 15 to 18 percent of the of the cadets are from Louisiana,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s not really that surprising since Louisiana sits at the mouth of the Mississippi River, one of the most important shipping arteries in the nation. \u201cA majority of them have a goal of being a pilot on the Mississippi River. So, a lot of them will go down and work, offshore supply vessels,\u201d said Achenbach. He goes on to say the desire is to have them stay in the Great Lakes region because of how skilled the cadets become, \u201cWe\u2019re very supported by the Great Lakes industry and a cadet sea project on a Great Lakes freighter cost their company about $5,000, you know, so they\u2019re, you know, that that\u2019s how they support us. Our way of supporting is encouraging all the cadets, even though some of the great state of Louisiana to stay on the Great Lakes for a couple of years.\u201d\n\nWhile most want to work as deck officers, there is also an engineering program that prepares cadets to operate and maintain engines and machinery. Second year engineering cadet Karson Keyser is one of them, \u201cBorn right around the Baton Rouge area. But spent most of my life in Louisiana. Spent a little bit of time in Texas. Okay, but, Louisiana is the home\u2026 Most people that are coming out of New Orleans, river area, they\u2019re coming up here to hopefully become pilots in the Mississippi River. But, my pilot friend, super close with family. Great family. He sent me up here as like, no, you\u2019re going to be an engineer. And I said, okay, I trust you.\u201d\n\nWhile a majority of GLMA\u2019s nearly 200 cadets are from Michigan, it\u2019s just one of six state maritime academies in the country. Achenbach said Louisiana is not the only place outside Michigan sending high school students their way, \u201cWell, obviously up beyond the Great Lakes states. We\u2019ve got one from Montana. We\u2019ve had from Hawaii, from Alaska.\u201d\n\nMost of the cadets from Louisiana have probably never heard of Traverse City before coming here. Besides the winter weather, Karson really likes it, \u201cIt\u2019s a unique place. So, when I tell people back home, there\u2019s a place back home, Hammond, Louisiana. It really makes me think about a place back home. Kind of like a medium sized city. It\u2019s super clean up here, too. Super, super clean. I\u2019ve seen that.\u201d\n\nEven though they have a chance to go home during the year, Karson said being so far away can, you can long for being home, \u201cYou know, so up here, FaceTime is my best friend. I get to talk to my mom, my sister, my grandparents. But we get, like, weekend trips home every once in a while. We get a spring break and then going home for Christmas.\u201d",
