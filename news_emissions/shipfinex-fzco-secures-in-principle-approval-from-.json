    "summary": "Shipfinex's VARA approval in Dubai will tokenize vessel assets using blockchain. This venture presents an opportunity for investors to fractionally own ships, but also introduces new regulatory risks. We remain skeptical of the environmental impact of democratizing ship ownership, especially with the potential for increased utilization of older, less efficient vessels.",
