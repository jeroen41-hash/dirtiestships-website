    "summary": "FuelEU Maritime incentivizes LNG shipowners to switch to Bio-LNG due to its favorable lifecycle GHG emissions. Bio-LNG, produced via onshore purification and liquefaction, utilizes existing LNG infrastructure without requiring vessel retrofitting. Despite potential GHG reductions, dirtiestships.com remains skeptical of the long-term sustainability and scalability of Bio-LNG as a widespread solution.",
    "content": "The International Maritime Organisation\u2019s (IMO) Net Zero Framework (NZF) adjournment increases the relative importance of the European Union (EU) regulations, including FuelEU maritime and EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). In addition to their own decarbonisation targets shipowners with liquefied natural gas (LNG) engines are financially encouraged to switch to Bio-LNG under EU regulations.\n\nThe FuelEU Maritime strongly favours Biomethane (specifically Bio-LNG) as a compliance option because of its low to negative life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Biomethane is also a drop in fuel meaning it can be used on LNG fuelled ships without conversion. Ship operators can accrue FuelEU surplus which they are able to bank for future years or sell to operators using fossil fuel under a pooling arrangement.\n\nBut what is Bio-LNG and Biomethane and how is it produced and delivered?\n\nUse of Biomethane\n\nBio-LNG is compatible with existing LNG engines, transfer systems and infrastructure, once it has been upgraded to Biomethane and liquefied. Significant GHG reductions are easy to achieve with minimal retrofitting of LNG vessels. Dual fuel engines can commonly burn LNG or Bio-LNG as well as diesel or biofuels if required. This provides more options should suitable infrastructure not be available in ports. This is known as de-risking.\n\nInfrastructure, Bunkering and Storage\n\nBio-LNG is stored in cryogenic tanks at the same temperature as fossil LNG (\u2013162\u00b0C) and the same insulated pipes are used for both.\n\nBio-LNG can make use of the growing LNG bunkering network already in place. This includes the following methods of delivery to the ship:\n\n\u2022 Ship-to-ship transfer\n\n\u2022 Truck-to-ship\n\n\u2022 Terminal-based refuelling\n\nProduction and Liquefaction\n\nBio-LNG can be produced in two ways:\n\nOnshore production and liquefaction\n\n\u2022 Liquefied Biomethane is purified to remove components that would freeze, corrode equipment or degrade LNG quality at cryogenic temperatures prior to liquefaction. It is also filtered after liquefaction to remove debris.\n\n\u2022 Biomethane is cooled to -162 \u00b0C at near atmospheric pressure to turn the gas into a liquid (liquefaction).\n\nIntegration with existing LNG terminals\n\nShipowners can contract on a \u201cmass balance\u201d basis. This provides creditability, compliance and market functionality. It means that the amount of Bio-LNG delivered to a customer over a certain period cannot exceed the Biomethane produced and liquefied over the same period.\n\nThis applies when:\n\n\u2022 Bio-LNG and fossil LNG are physically mixed\n\n\u2022 Deliveries are done through shared tanks, trucks or terminals\n\n\u2022 Sustainability certificates are transferred separately\n\nThe quantity sold as renewable fuel should never exceed the net Biomethane liquefied and available for delivery, after accounting for all process and logistics losses, regardless of physical mixing.\n\nUsing the same tanks, trucks, terminals and engines for fossil fuels create the following advantages:\n\n\u2022 Lowers costs\n\n\u2022 Assists scalability\n\n\u2022 Makes use of existing LNG hubs\n\nEnvironmental Benefits\n\nBiomethane ships offer several significant environmental advantages.\n\nFeedstock variables\n\n\u2022 Waste-derived Biomethane provides the greatest benefits.\n\n\u2022 Crop-based Biomethane still provides emissions reductions, however there are sustainability restrictions because RED II addresses anything that competes with food production and land use.\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nUnder EU regulatory frameworks EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime, Bio-LNG counts as a renewable/ low carbon fuel. This helps operators to reduce their exposure to penalties.\n\nUnder FuelEU some may make a financial gain by selling the surplus created by burning Bio-LNG to operators in deficit, who consume higher carbon fossil fuels.\n\nConclusion\n\nBiomethane offers immediate emissions reductions, compliance advantages, and operational feasibility unmatched by many alternative fuels in the short term.\n\nThe main challenges include sustainable Biomethane supply, controlling methane slip, and ensuring sustainability certification integrity.",
