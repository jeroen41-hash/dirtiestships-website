    "summary": "Container lines are increasing Energy Transition Surcharges to $170 per 40' dry container due to expanding EU ETS obligations. These ETS obligations now include methane and nitrous oxide, alongside CO2 emissions, increasing costs. Surcharges will be adjusted quarterly based on carbon prices, but expect further increases as FuelEU Maritime penalties begin.",

The companies justified the increases by the heavier obligations placed on them by the EU ETS. From 2026 on, they have to include all their emissions in the scheme, compared to 75% in 2025 and 40% in 2024. The field of application of the system has also been widened to include methane and nitrogen protoxide, as well as CO\u00b2. The companies also point out that they have incurred extra costs in meeting the requirements of the FuelEU regulation because of changing biofuel prices. The result is an average surcharge of USD170 for the transportation of a 40\u2019 dry container from Asia to North Europe during the first quarter and USD250 for a 40\u2019 reefer.\n\nThe surcharges are reviewed by the companies on a quarterly basis in line with changes in the price for a tonne of carbon. It has yet to be decided definitively if they...",
