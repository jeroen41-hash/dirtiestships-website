    "title": "Barbados to explore green shipping corridors",
    "summary": "Barbados is \"exploring\" green shipping corridors with an IMO-funded study, conveniently ignoring the massive carbon debt of its existing cruise ship industry. This \"pre-feasibility\" exercise seems designed to generate headlines, not reduce the tonnes of HFO burned offshore daily. Don't expect actual emissions reductions any time soon.",
    "content": "Barbados is exploring ways to advance green shipping corridors to cut maritime emissions, starting with a pre-feasibility study commissioned by the IMO. As announced, an initial meeting with the Government and national stakeholders in the framework of the Barbados Green Shipping Corridors: Pre-Feasibility, Policy and Regulatory Pathways study was held on 12 February.\n\nThe study is funded through the IMO Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) and builds on earlier work undertaken under the GreenVoyage2050 Programme, including support for countries to develop National Action Plans (NAPs) on maritime decarbonization.\n\nParticipants from Barbados included the Maritime Transport Administration, the Ministry of Tourism and International Transport, and Barbados Port Inc.\n\nThe study aims to assess Barbados\u2019 readiness and potential to participate in scalable zero-emission shipping initiatives, while identifying policy, regulatory and infrastructure considerations at national and regional level. IMO will continue to work closely with the Government of Barbados and relevant stakeholders as the work progresses.",
