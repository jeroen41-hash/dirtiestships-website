    "title": "LR Advisory to Support Geogas on FuelEU Compliance and Pooling",
    "summary": "Geogas enlists Lloyd's Register to navigate FuelEU Maritime, a scheme that allows carbon credit trading. This likely aims to offset continued fossil fuel use across their fleet. Will Geogas reduce emissions, or simply buy their way out of penalties?",
    "content": "Lloyd\u2019s Register (LR) Advisory has been appointed by Geneva-based LPG trader and shipowner Geogas to help develop a multi-year emissions compliance plan and operational approach to FuelEU Maritime pooling.\n\nLR Advisory will guide the commercial impact of current and upcoming emissions rules and support Geogas Trading in setting up its own FuelEU pooling structure, it said in an email statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe project will also cover operational steps needed to implement pooling and manage associated risks.\n\nThe pooling mechanism under FuelEU Maritime allows shipping companies to comply with the regulation by selling their surplus carbon reduction to others.\n\nLR Advisory will also assist in mapping and mitigating commercial exposure linked to FuelEU requirements as the European regulatory framework tightens.",
