    "content": "Northern Lights has handed out a fresh round of CO2 shipping business to three of Japan and Malaysia\u2019s biggest blue\u2011chip owners.\n\nThe Oslo\u2011based CCS JV \u2013 owned by Equinor, TotalEnergies and Shell \u2013 has awarded a long\u2011term time charter for one 12,000 cu m liquid CO2 carrier to a consortium of Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line) and MISC, with a second sister vessel set to go to the same pair in April 2026. In parallel, Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) has secured two long\u2011term charters for another two newbuild CO2 carriers.\n\nThe first three vessels will each have 12,000 cu m cargo capacity, significantly lifting Northern Lights\u2019 seaborne capacity beyond its initial 7,500 cu m trio and aligning with signed customer contracts and the project to lift transport and storage capability above 5m tonnes of CO2 per year. All four new ships will be owned by the respective shipowners.\n\nChina\u2019s Dalian Shipbuilding Offshore (DSOC) and South Korea\u2019s HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) have been tapped to build the vessels, with deliveries scheduled between the second half of 2028 and the first half of 2029.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to significantly grow our transport capacity by adding vessels to our existing Northern Lights fleet,\u201d said managing director Tim Heijn. \u201cWith an expanded fleet, we will be able to deliver on our commitments to our customers. It will also enable us to optimise operations and increase flexibility.\u201d\n\nThe move follows the delivery of the 7,500 cu m Northern Pioneer, Northern Pathfinder and Northern Phoenix from DSIC/DSOC since late 2024, all managed by K Line under phase one of Norway\u2019s Longship CCS project. A fourth identical vessel, owned and operated by Bernhard Schulte, will join in 2026.\n\nNorthern Lights began injecting liquefied CO2 for permanent subsea storage in August 2025 and already has commercial agreements with emitters including Yara, \u00d8rsted and Stockholm Exergi.",
