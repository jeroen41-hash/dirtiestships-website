Despite delays in global carbon pricing agreements, the shipping industry's biggest players are pushing forward with significant investments in emissions-reducing technologies, driven by regional regulations and long-term decarbonization goals. This signals a sustained commitment to reducing the sector's environmental impact, even amidst regulatory uncertainty.

## Dual-Fuel Vessels Dominate New Orders

A Reuters analysis of vessel delivery data through 2028 reveals a clear trend: new ship orders are increasingly dominated by vessels capable of running on alternative fuels. While most of the current global fleet of nearly 50,000 commercial ships relies on fuel oil or gas oil, the industry is preparing for the IMO's target of net-zero emissions by or around 2050. Companies have begun ordering dual-fuel ships that can use both traditional fuels and greener alternatives like liquefied natural gas (LNG), methanol, and ammonia, as reported by marinelink.com. By the end of December, over $150 billion had been invested in dual-fuel vessels, according to data from the World Shipping Council. The numbers speak for themselves: 1,126 dual-fuel container ships and vehicle carriers have either been delivered or are on order, a 28% increase compared to the previous year. Dual-fuel vessels now account for 74% of the overall container ship and vehicle carrier orderbook, showing that investments in lower-emission fuel vessels continued even after the IMO delay. Pacific Basin's decision to buy four newbuild vessels running only on oil-derived fuels, citing the postponement of the IMO's carbon price, stands out as an exception.

## Regional Regulations Drive Investment

Many companies cited regional green fuel regulations as a major reason for continuing investments. The European Union's FuelEU Maritime regulation, which penalizes vessels failing to meet lower emissions targets, creates a strong business case for greener fleets. The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and voluntary initiatives provide further incentives. Ship owners with dual-fuel vessels will likely deploy them on EU voyages to avoid penalties under FuelEU Maritime and potentially receive rewards for over-compliance, according to Kenneth Tveter, an analyst at shipbroker Clarksons. This underscores the importance of understanding how EU ETS carbon costs impact specific routes and vessel types.

Major Horn of Africa port Djibouti and OPEC member Gabon have also introduced levies on maritime emissions, signaling a global move toward emission pricing.

## Industry Leaders Remain Committed

Despite the IMO postponement, major shipping companies are reaffirming their commitment to decarbonization. Alexander Saverys, CEO of Belgian ship owner CMB.Tech, stated they will continue investments in both ammonia bunkering and production. A Mitsui O.S.K. Lines spokesperson told Reuters the IMO postponement just means a longer transition to low and zero-carbon fuels, and the company remains focused on LNG-fuelled vessels and early-stage adoption of ammonia and methanol. Maersk, a pioneer in exploring alternative fuels, initially chose methanol but has since ordered LNG-fuelled ships and is now testing ethanol. NYK Group sees the one-year delay as an opportunity for discussion and refinement of the regulatory framework. Hakan Agnevall, CEO of Wartsila, believes the postponement is unlikely to affect customers with long-term investment perspectives.

## Potential Implications for CII Ratings

The shift towards dual-fuel vessels could have significant implications for [CII ratings](/cii.html). Vessels equipped with alternative fuel capabilities are likely to achieve better CII ratings, giving them a competitive advantage in the market, particularly on routes subject to stricter environmental regulations like those in the EU. As more data becomes available through EMSA MRV data, DirtiestShips.com will continue to provide insights into how specific vessel technologies and operational practices impact CII ratings and overall carbon emissions.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The shipping industry is demonstrating resilience in its decarbonization efforts. While a global carbon pricing mechanism remains uncertain, regional regulations and a long-term vision are driving substantial investments in cleaner technologies. This suggests that even without a unified global approach, the industry is moving towards a lower-emission future, albeit potentially at a slower and more regionally fragmented pace. The pace of adoption and ultimate impact on overall shipping emissions will depend on factors like the availability and cost of alternative fuels, the stringency of regional regulations, and the willingness of shippers to pay a premium for greener transport options.
