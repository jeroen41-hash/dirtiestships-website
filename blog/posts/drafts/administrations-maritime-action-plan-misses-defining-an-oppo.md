The Trump administration's recently unveiled Maritime Action Plan (MAP), intended to revitalize the US shipbuilding industry, conspicuously avoids addressing the pressing need for zero-emission vessels, raising concerns about its long-term effectiveness in a rapidly decarbonizing global shipping landscape. With international regulations tightening and competitors investing heavily in clean technologies, the MAP's focus on legacy technologies risks locking the US into outdated practices and ceding market share in the emerging green shipping sector.

## A Missed Opportunity for Green Shipping Leadership

The MAP, released on February 13, 2026, aims to rebuild US maritime capacity and resilience, citing the fact that less than 1% of new commercial ships are built domestically. However, its lack of emphasis on sustainable maritime fuels and next-generation vessels represents a significant oversight. As Antonio Santos, Federal Climate Policy Director at Pacific Environment, notes, true maritime leadership requires "building the cleanest and most efficient fleet in the world." The plan's silence on zero-emission technologies directly contradicts the direction the industry is heading, driven by both regulatory pressure and market demand. This puts the US at risk of falling behind nations like Finland, which are actively investing in zero-emission shipbuilding.

## The "Ship Tax" and its Economic Implications

A key proposal within the MAP is the imposition of a "ship tax" on foreign-built ships based on cargo weight, projected to generate $66 billion to $1.5 trillion over 10 years for a Maritime Security Trust Fund. This measure, likely to be viewed as a tariff on maritime trade, could have significant economic repercussions. Economists predict that these costs will ultimately be passed on to American consumers through increased prices on imported goods, potentially triggering retaliatory measures from trading partners. The potential economic fallout contrasts with the EU ETS, which aims to internalize the cost of carbon emissions and incentivize cleaner shipping practices. While the "ship tax" aims to bolster domestic shipbuilding, it could inadvertently harm overall US competitiveness by increasing trade costs.

## Neglecting Environmental Justice Concerns

The plan's emphasis on scaling up maritime activity while simultaneously rolling back environmental oversight raises serious concerns for communities near seaports, home to approximately 12% of the US population, who already bear a disproportionate burden of pollution. Without a cohesive strategy that integrates economic, security, environmental, and public health priorities, the MAP risks exacerbating existing environmental injustices. This approach is a stark contrast to the principles embedded in environmental regulations like those tracked by the EMSA MRV data, which aim to improve air quality and reduce pollution from maritime activities.

## Global Decarbonization Efforts are Accelerating

The article highlights that shipowners, financiers, and trading partners are increasingly making decisions based on clean maritime standards. The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) ongoing negotiations on a net-zero framework are setting the stage for global maritime competition. Nations and shipyards that are prepared to build compliant vessels stand to gain a significant advantage in this emerging market. This underscores the importance of initiatives like the EU ETS, which imposes carbon costs on ships operating within its jurisdiction. Companies failing to achieve favorable [CII ratings](/cii.html) also face commercial disadvantages, further driving the demand for cleaner vessels.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The US Maritime Action Plan, while ambitious in its goal to revitalize domestic shipbuilding, overlooks the critical need for investing in zero-emission technologies and sustainable maritime fuels. By focusing on legacy technologies and neglecting the global push for decarbonization, the plan risks undermining US competitiveness in the long run. The shipping industry is undergoing a profound transformation driven by regulatory pressures and market demand for cleaner vessels. Without a strategic shift toward sustainable shipping practices, the US risks being left behind. Monitoring [company emissions rankings](/companies.html) and analyzing [emissions data](/charts.html) will become crucial in assessing the true impact of the MAP on the global shipping industry's trajectory toward net zero.
