The growing complexity of carbon regulations in the shipping industry is creating a compliance headache for shipowners, prompting calls for a unified global framework. As regional schemes like the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime proliferate alongside IMO proposals, the need for harmonization is becoming increasingly urgent to avoid duplicated effort and costs.

## A Patchwork of Regulations: The Problem

According to BAR Technologies, a wind propulsion firm, the current regulatory landscape is becoming increasingly fragmented. John Cooper, CEO of BAR Technologies, is quoted as saying, "Carbon compliance is becoming more fragmented by the month.” The core of the issue lies in the "patchwork of schemes with different baselines, rules and cost mechanisms" that are emerging. This refers to regulations like the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, and upcoming IMO proposals, each with their own specific requirements. For example, the EU ETS now requires shipowners to purchase carbon allowances for emissions on voyages to, from, and within the EU. The different requirements and overlapping scope increase administrative burden and compliance costs.

## The Impact of EU CBAM

While the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) doesn't directly tax shipping emissions, BAR Technologies notes that it introduces indirect costs for major seaborne commodities. CBAM levies a carbon tax on imports into the EU based on the carbon intensity of their production. This means that goods transported by ships using more carbon-intensive fuels will face a higher overall cost to import into the EU, making shipping a crucial consideration in overall CBAM compliance. Shippers will be pressured to prefer cleaner shipping solutions to reduce the overall carbon footprint of goods subject to CBAM. This exemplifies how carbon pricing is becoming increasingly embedded in global trade.

## Calls for a Global Carbon Framework

BAR Technologies advocates for a globally agreed carbon policy with a bunker-level collection mechanism to fund climate investment. This mechanism would collect a carbon levy directly from fuel purchases, simplifying the process and avoiding duplication across regional schemes. This concept is similar to proposals for a global carbon levy discussed at the IMO. A global approach offers several advantages. A uniform levy across all bunkers avoids distorting competition and provides a level playing field for all shipowners. It also simplifies compliance, as ships would only need to comply with one set of rules, regardless of where they operate. For instance, this could reduce the reliance on the EU MRV data the DirtiestShips.com uses, if a more universal database were created.

## ECSA Echoes Concerns

The European Community Shipowners' Associations (ECSA) has also expressed concerns about the proliferation of regional regulations. ECSA has urged the European Commission to withdraw EU shipping regulations once the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) is adopted. This further emphasizes the industry's desire for a unified global approach to decarbonization. However, the adoption of a comprehensive IMO framework has faced significant hurdles, with disagreements among member states on key issues such as carbon pricing mechanisms.

## The Role of Wind Propulsion

Despite the uncertainty surrounding a global framework, BAR Technologies emphasizes that inaction is not an option. They advocate for the adoption of wind-assisted propulsion technologies to deliver immediate emissions reductions. These technologies can help shipowners reduce their carbon footprint and improve their [CII ratings](/cii.html), a crucial factor under existing regulations. Wind propulsion, along with other alternative fuels and energy-efficient technologies, will play a vital role in meeting the increasingly stringent emissions targets being implemented globally.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The growing complexity of carbon regulations presents both challenges and opportunities for the shipping industry. While a fragmented regulatory landscape creates compliance burdens, it also incentivizes innovation and the adoption of cleaner technologies. The push for a global carbon framework highlights the need for international cooperation to effectively address shipping emissions. In the meantime, shipowners need to navigate the existing patchwork of regulations while exploring strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and improve their [company rankings](/companies.html). Failure to do so will result in increased operational costs due to carbon pricing schemes like the EU ETS, and potentially reduced access to markets that enforce carbon border adjustment mechanisms.
