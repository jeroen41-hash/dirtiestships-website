The European Commission's plan to phase out soybean-based biofuels by 2030 is facing strong opposition from the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE), throwing a spotlight on the complexities and potential pitfalls of attributing deforestation risk to specific commodities used in biofuel production. This dispute has significant implications for the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and, consequently, for shipping's decarbonization efforts, given the potential role of biofuels in meeting emissions reduction targets and influencing the [CII ratings](/cii.html) of ships using these fuels.

## ABIOVE's Challenge to the ILUC Assessment

ABIOVE is contesting the European Commission's methodology for assessing Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC) associated with soybean cultivation. The Commission's draft regulation, released on January 21st, proposes a linear phase-out of "high ILUC-risk" biofuels from 2024 to 2030. According to ABIOVE, the updated assessment prepared by Guidehouse, which found that 14.1% of global soybean expansion between 2014 and 2021 occurred on high-carbon-stock land, contains methodological flaws that unfairly classify soybean as a "high ILUC-risk" feedstock (hellenicshippingnews.com). This threshold places soybeans above the 1% expansion and 100,000-hectare benchmark used to determine high ILUC risk.

ABIOVE's analysis, utilizing Brazil’s MapBiomas dataset and alternative mapping by Serasa Experian, estimates soybean expansion over forest in Brazil at 3.6%-5.5% for land-use transitions strictly within the 2014–2021 period. This is a substantial difference from the Commission's figure. Even when applying a methodology closer to Guidehouse’s, ABIOVE calculated a 10.4% share before adjusting for productivity factors. ABIOVE argues that the Guidehouse approach inflates results by combining a longer deforestation reference period with a shorter expansion period.

## The Productivity Factor Debate

Another point of contention is the soybean "productivity factor" (PF) used in the ILUC formula. Guidehouse set the PF at 1.0, while ABIOVE contends that Brazil’s widespread soybean–maize multi-cropping system increases the effective energy yield per hectare and should result in a PF of 1.2 to 1.3. Applying a PF of 1.3 would reduce soybeans’ calculated share of expansion over high-carbon-stock land to 7.9%, according to ABIOVE’s recalculation. When using only 2014–2021 land-use data and the higher PF, the group claims soybeans’ adjusted share could fall as low as 2.8%, placing it in a low-risk category. The outcome of this debate could significantly affect the overall carbon footprint attributed to soybean-derived biofuels and, therefore, their viability under the EU's RED.

## Market Implications and the Renewable Energy Directive

The EU's Renewable Energy Directive aims to promote renewable energy sources while minimizing deforestation-linked imports. ABIOVE argues that relying on inaccurate data could distort market flows and unfairly penalize specific commodities. The association is urging the Commission and Guidehouse to revise the data and methodology before finalizing the delegated act. The current draft regulation, if adopted, would gradually reduce the maximum contribution of high ILUC-risk biofuels to 0% by 2030. This could significantly impact the biofuel market and EU–Mercosur trade dynamics. The current status of this regulation would influence [company rankings](/companies.html) for shipping lines reliant on biofuels.

## Brazilian Audit Concerns

Adding another layer of complexity, a recent audit by Brazil’s federal audit office (TCU) revealed that 60% of the soybeans used in biodiesel production have irregularities in their anti-deforestation certification under the national biofuels policy, RenovaBio. This audit highlights the challenges in ensuring the sustainability of biofuel feedstocks, even with existing certification programs. Only 40% of biodiesel produced by soybean plants certified under the CBIO decarbonization credits market can be verified as deforestation-free. This compares unfavourably to corn-based ethanol (70%) and sugarcane ethanol (85%). The audit raises questions about the effectiveness of current monitoring and enforcement mechanisms and could further influence the EU's assessment of soybean-based biofuels.

## Impacts on Shipping Emissions and the EU ETS

The availability and sustainability of biofuels are crucial factors in shipping's efforts to comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations. As ships are brought under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the cost of carbon emissions will rise, making alternative fuels like biofuels more economically attractive. However, the ongoing debate surrounding the ILUC risk of soybean-based biofuels could limit their use in the shipping sector. If soybean biofuels are deemed unsustainable and phased out, shipping companies may need to rely more heavily on other alternative fuels, such as advanced biofuels, ammonia, or hydrogen, which may have their own challenges in terms of availability, cost, and infrastructure. The outcome of this regulation could greatly impact the [EU ETS carbon costs](/charts.html).

What this means for shipping emissions: The uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of soybean-based biofuels creates a significant challenge for the shipping industry. The industry needs access to reliable and sustainable alternative fuels to meet decarbonization targets and comply with regulations like the EU ETS and [CII ratings](/cii.html). A restrictive approach to biofuels based on potentially flawed ILUC assessments could hinder progress towards these goals and necessitate a faster transition to other, potentially less readily available, alternative fuels. The industry should closely monitor the developments surrounding the EU's RED and advocate for a science-based and transparent approach to assessing the sustainability of biofuels.
