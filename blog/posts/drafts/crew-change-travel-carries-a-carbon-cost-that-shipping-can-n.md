The shipping industry's intense focus on decarbonizing vessels risks overlooking a significant source of emissions: the global movement of seafarers for crew changes. While efforts to optimize vessel performance and reduce fuel consumption are critical, the Scope 3.6 emissions generated by millions of flights taken annually for crew changes are substantial and increasingly scrutinized by investors and charterers. This post examines why shipping can no longer ignore the carbon cost of crew change travel and the steps companies can take to address these emissions.

## The Scale of the Crew Change Emissions Problem

According to an article in splash247.com, "Crew change travel carries a carbon cost that shipping can no longer ignore." While precise figures are hard to come by without widespread reporting, the article highlights that millions of flights are taken each year to facilitate crew changes. The environmental impact of these movements rarely features in carbon accounting, despite their scale and inevitability. This is a crucial omission, especially as companies increasingly face pressure to report their complete emissions profile, including Scope 3 emissions.

The fact that Scope 3 emissions are not currently regulated internationally doesn't diminish their importance. National disclosure regimes are beginning to include them, and stakeholders are demanding greater transparency. As ship operators reduce at-source emissions, the relative impact of crew travel will become more apparent. The article emphasizes that addressing these emissions is becoming a matter of commercial credibility as well as environmental responsibility.

## Measuring and Reducing Crew Change Travel Emissions

The first step, as outlined in the splash247.com article, is to quantify the emissions associated with crew change travel. Once data is available, operators can identify potential areas for reduction. However, the article acknowledges that reducing crew change emissions is challenging due to the nature of shipping operations. Vessel schedules, port locations, and infrastructure limitations often restrict travel options. Short-notice bookings to accommodate operational changes further complicate matters.

Despite these challenges, incremental improvements are possible. Operators can consider the fleet efficiency and sustainability credentials of available carriers when making travel arrangements. Prioritizing direct flights can also reduce emissions by avoiding the carbon intensity of multiple take-offs and landings. These small gains contribute to a culture of accountability and demonstrate a commitment to reducing environmental impact.

## The Role of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Offsets

The article notes the potential of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a direct reduction mechanism. However, the current cost and availability of SAF remain significant barriers to widespread adoption. Ship operators can consider investing in SAF for a portion of their travel volumes and gradually scaling up as budgets and infrastructure allow. This phased approach, coupled with clear reporting, can be positively viewed by auditors and stakeholders.

When emissions cannot be avoided or reduced, compensation strategies, such as carbon offsets, can play a role. The splash247.com article emphasizes the importance of choosing high-quality, transparent offset programs with third-party certification, robust audit trails, and verifiable project documentation. Blue carbon projects, such as mangrove restoration initiatives, are particularly relevant to the maritime sector due to their alignment with ocean health and biodiversity.

## Connecting to Existing Regulatory Frameworks

While the article focuses on Scope 3.6 emissions, it's crucial to contextualize this within the broader regulatory landscape that DirtiestShips.com covers. The EU ETS, for instance, currently focuses on Scope 1 emissions from vessels but may expand to include other emission sources in the future. Furthermore, the [CII ratings](/cii.html) system, used to grade the operational efficiency of ships, indirectly incentivizes companies to optimize routes and reduce fuel consumption, which can also impact crew change logistics. Companies with poor [company rankings](/companies.html) may face increased pressure to address all aspects of their emissions profile, including Scope 3 emissions. EMSA MRV data, which forms the basis of our data analysis, provides valuable insights into vessel performance and can be used to track progress in reducing overall emissions, including those associated with crew operations. Looking at the latest updates on the [news feed](/news.html), we see a trend of increased pressure on shipping companies to report on ALL emissions. The [emissions data](/charts.html) paints a clear picture that more needs to be done.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The splash247.com article serves as a reminder that decarbonization requires a holistic approach. As the shipping industry makes strides in reducing vessel emissions, the relative impact of crew change travel will become increasingly significant. Companies that proactively measure, reduce, and compensate for these emissions will be better positioned to meet evolving regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations. Ignoring Scope 3.6 emissions is no longer a viable option for a sector striving for sustainability.
