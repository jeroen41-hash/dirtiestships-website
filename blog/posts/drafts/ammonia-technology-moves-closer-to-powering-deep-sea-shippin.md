The race to decarbonize deep-sea shipping is gaining momentum with ammonia propulsion systems moving closer to commercial reality. As pressure mounts from regulations like the EU ETS and increasingly stringent [CII ratings](/cii.html), ship owners are actively exploring alternative fuels, and ammonia is emerging as a frontrunner despite its inherent challenges.

## Dual-Fuel Ammonia Engines: A Step Forward

According to hellenicshippingnews.com, engine developers are making significant strides in bringing dual-fuel ammonia engines to market. Everllence's new ME-LGIA engine integrates advanced safety barriers, digital connectivity, and fuel flexibility, marking a notable advancement. This engine, based on the diesel principle, employs liquid gas injection, enabling operation on both ammonia and conventional fuels. This flexibility is crucial for shipowners navigating the transition, as it allows them to switch between fuel types while bunkering infrastructure and supply chains for ammonia mature.

While LNG and methanol have been early leaders in alternative fuels, the article notes there are currently three ammonia-capable ships in operation and 45 on order, signaling growing interest and investment in ammonia as a viable long-term solution. These orders include vessels for shipowners like Höegh Autoliners and Eastern Pacific Shipping, which will feature Everllence’s newly launched two-stroke ammonia engines (10–15 MW).

## Addressing Ammonia's Challenges

Ammonia offers compelling advantages. It is carbon-free at the point of combustion and can substantially reduce overall emissions when produced from renewable sources. Its volumetric energy density makes it suitable for long-haul voyages typical of deep-sea shipping. However, significant hurdles remain. The article highlights ammonia’s high toxicity and corrosiveness, demanding stringent safety measures and specialized handling protocols far exceeding those for conventional fuels. This requires substantial investment in crew training, bunkering infrastructure, and technologies to mitigate risks.

Everllence emphasizes integrated safety barriers in their ME-LGIA engine design, including double-walled piping with continuous ventilation, ammonia release mitigation systems, and fail-safe fuel valve trains. The engine also features digital connectivity for real-time data flow to shore-based monitoring systems, enabling remote assistance and operational optimization.

## Engineering and Testing Efforts

The development of the ME-LGIA engine represents a considerable engineering undertaking. Everllence has invested over 150,000 hours in design and validation since July 2023, conducting over 800 tests to ensure performance and safety. These tests encompassed combustion behavior, emissions profiles, material compatibility, and failure-mode analysis under various operational conditions. Crucially, the engine's thermal efficiency with ammonia remains comparable to diesel, and emissions meet regulatory requirements.

The article notes that the engine meets Tier II and Tier III NOₓ requirements with abatement, and nitrous oxide formation is intrinsically low, potentially supporting greenhouse gas reductions of more than 90 percent. However, the article correctly acknowledges that life-cycle emissions warrant careful attention. To achieve true zero-carbon status, the ammonia must be produced using renewable energy sources, such as green hydrogen via electrolysis. This aspect of fuel production is critical when assessing the overall environmental impact and the potential for improvement in a ship's [CII ratings](/cii.html).

## Implications for EU ETS and Company Rankings

The adoption of ammonia propulsion technologies directly impacts shipping companies' obligations under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). By transitioning to carbon-free fuels like green ammonia, companies can significantly reduce their CO2 emissions and, consequently, their ETS carbon costs. This has significant implications for [company rankings](/companies.html) on DirtiestShips.com, as those investing in and deploying alternative fuels will likely see improvements in their emissions profiles relative to competitors. The data collected through the EU MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) system and analysed by EMSA will be critical in tracking the progress of ammonia adoption and its impact on overall shipping emissions.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The developments reported signal that ammonia is rapidly progressing from a theoretical alternative fuel to a tangible option for deep-sea shipping. While challenges related to safety, infrastructure, and green ammonia production remain, the introduction of commercially viable dual-fuel engines represents a significant step towards decarbonizing the industry. As more data becomes available through systems like EU MRV, we can better assess the real-world impact of ammonia adoption on shipping emissions and its contribution to meeting global decarbonization targets.
