The shipping industry's path to decarbonization remains fraught with uncertainty, as a new analysis suggests that any weakening of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF) could severely hamper the uptake of zero-emission fuels and undermine a just transition. The framework, agreed in principle in April 2025, is facing potential revisions that could significantly impact its effectiveness in driving down shipping emissions. This could have serious consequences for companies attempting to comply with regulations like the EU ETS and achieve higher [CII ratings](/cii.html).

## The Fragility of the Net-Zero Framework

According to a report by UCL Shipping and Oceans Research Group for the Getting to Zero Coalition, the "Net Zero Framework 'as is'" – the agreement reached at MEPC 83 – is the only option capable of providing the necessary demand signal and revenue stream to incentivize the adoption of scalable zero-emission fuels. The report, highlighted by hellenicshippingnews.com, warns that alternative scenarios, aimed at appeasing dissenting governments, risk delaying the availability of these fuels into the 2040s. Professor Tristan Smith of UCL emphasizes the fragility of the compromise, suggesting that attempts to further modify the NZF could lead to deadlock and a patchwork of regional regulations, like the existing EU ETS, which are designed to accelerate decarbonization.

## Three Scenarios and Their Consequences

The UCL analysis explores three potential scenarios for the future of shipping's regulatory landscape:

1.  **NZF 'as is':** The original framework agreed upon at MEPC 83 is adopted without changes, coming into force in 2028. This is the scenario the report advocates for, arguing it poses the lowest transition risk.

2.  **Single-tier global fuel standard (GFS):** A compromised approach that simplifies the NZF's two-tier GHG fuel intensity architecture while retaining some economic elements.

3.  **NZF without an economic element:** A drastically weakened framework stripped of its compliance market, non-compliance costs, Net-Zero Fund, and incentives for using zero- and near-zero emission fuels. This scenario would essentially leave only an aspirational GHG reduction trajectory with no teeth.

The report clearly favors the first option, arguing that the latter two would fail to provide the necessary incentives for fuel transition and would disproportionately impact lower-income countries.

## Impact on Emissions Reduction and Investment

The analysis highlights that even the "NZF 'as is'" is projected to deliver only around 10% absolute GHG reduction by 2030 against 2008 levels, falling short of the Revised Strategy's 20-30% checkpoint. Weaker scenarios would fare even worse. This is a critical point for DirtiestShips.com, as we track the real-world impact of these policies on [emissions data](/charts.html). A diluted framework could significantly slow down progress, making it harder for companies to meet targets and improve their [CII ratings](/cii.html), which are increasingly scrutinized by stakeholders and regulators.

Furthermore, the report warns that deviating from the agreed-upon framework is likely to encourage regulatory fragmentation, heighten investment risk, and decrease alignment with the IMO’s overall emissions reduction strategy. This fragmentation could lead to increased costs for shipping companies operating across different regions and complicates long-term investment decisions in alternative fuels and technologies. The risk of "regulatory fragmentation" echoes concerns we've raised before about the potential for regional regulations like the EU ETS to diverge from global standards, creating compliance challenges for international fleets. The EU ETS carbon costs are already impacting companies and potentially factoring into their [company emissions rankings](/companies.html).

## What this means for shipping emissions

The future of shipping emissions hinges on the IMO's upcoming decisions. This analysis paints a concerning picture, suggesting that any attempts to weaken the Net-Zero Framework could have dire consequences for the industry's ability to decarbonize effectively. Delaying investment decisions and embracing weaker regulations will not only impede progress towards emissions reduction targets but also risk a more expensive and inequitable transition for all stakeholders. The pressure is on for the IMO to maintain the integrity of the NZF and move forward with its implementation to avoid further delays and ensure a sustainable future for the shipping industry.
