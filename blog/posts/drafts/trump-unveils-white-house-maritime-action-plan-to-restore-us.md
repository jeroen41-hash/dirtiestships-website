The Trump Administration's newly unveiled Maritime Action Plan (MAP) aims to revitalize the US shipbuilding industry, a sector currently responsible for less than 1% of global commercial vessel construction, according to gcaptain.com. While the plan focuses on bolstering US seapower, its potential implications for global shipping emissions are noteworthy, particularly if it leads to a significant shift in where vessels are built and operated. Any new regulations or costs have the potential to affect ships sailing internationally, especially if other regions reciprocate with similar legislation.

## Ambitious Goals, Uncertain Funding

The MAP's core objective, as stated in the gcaptain.com article, is not merely to increase the number of vessels built in the US, but to "reconstitute a maritime industrial base capable of self-sustained production." This entails rebuilding an entire ecosystem of shipyards, suppliers, workforce, and design capacity. To achieve this, the plan proposes substantial government investment and intervention, which traditionally have been avoided by Republicans.

A critical element of the MAP is a proposed fee on foreign-built vessels entering US ports, assessed based on the weight of imported tonnage. The article cites a potential range of $66 billion to $1.5 trillion over ten years, depending on the fee level (one cent to 25 cents per kilogram). This revenue could fund a new Maritime Security Trust Fund, providing dedicated funding for American shipbuilding. Without this dedicated fund, the MAP's ambitious goals may remain unrealized.

## Maritime Prosperity Zones and Deregulation

The plan also envisions establishing 100 Maritime Prosperity Zones (MPZs) across US coasts, Great Lakes, river systems, and territories. These zones would offer tax advantages to attract private investment in shipyards, supply chain companies, workforce training, and advanced manufacturing. The success of these zones hinges on well-designed eligibility criteria and enforcement mechanisms.

Furthermore, the MAP includes extensive deregulatory actions aimed at streamlining compliance, clarifying policies, and reducing unnecessary red tape. This includes revising merchant mariner training standards and reducing mandatory able seaman billet requirements.

## Potential Impacts on Shipping Emissions

While the MAP primarily focuses on domestic shipbuilding, it could indirectly affect global shipping emissions. Here are a few potential connections to topics this site covers:

*   **Shifting shipbuilding locations:** If the MAP successfully incentivizes US shipbuilding, it could shift the location of new vessel construction. Different shipyards have varying environmental performance and technologies. A shift towards US shipyards could impact the overall carbon footprint of new builds.
*   **Impact of vessel fee:** Any increase in fees for ships calling at US ports could impact operations. This may encourage companies to optimize operations, route vessels differently, reduce speed or even renew fleets. This may have a positive impact in [CII ratings](/cii.html), [EU ETS carbon costs](/ets.html) and our [company rankings](/companies.html).
*   **Influence on other regions:** The MAP's protectionist elements could prompt retaliatory measures from other countries, potentially leading to increased trade barriers and inefficiencies in global shipping. This could lead to increased emissions due to longer voyages or less optimized routes.
*   **Technology adoption:** The MAP's emphasis on digital engineering and AI could accelerate the adoption of emission-reducing technologies in shipbuilding and vessel operations. This aligns with broader efforts to decarbonize the shipping industry.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The Trump Administration's Maritime Action Plan, while primarily aimed at revitalizing US shipbuilding, has potential implications for global shipping emissions. While the specifics of its impact remain uncertain and dependent on congressional approval and effective implementation, the plan's proposed vessel fee, Maritime Prosperity Zones, and emphasis on technology adoption could influence vessel construction, operation patterns, and the broader transition towards a more sustainable shipping industry. Tracking the implementation and knock-on effects of the MAP will be important for understanding its ultimate impact on the sector's carbon footprint. Data from sources like the [EMSA MRV data](/emissions_data.html) can help track these changes over time.
