The UK's ambitious climate goals for the maritime sector face a critical juncture as the shipping industry voices strong opposition to the impending expansion of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to domestic shipping in 2026. Concerns center around the policy's potential to harm UK competitiveness, increase costs for island communities reliant on maritime transport, and ultimately, hinder rather than accelerate progress towards net-zero emissions. This raises fundamental questions about the design and implementation of carbon pricing mechanisms in shipping, especially as they intersect with the EU ETS, fuel availability, and port infrastructure.

## Industry Fears "Untenable Position" Under UK ETS Expansion

The UK Chamber of Shipping has expressed deep reservations, arguing that the sector cannot achieve meaningful emissions reductions without the necessary fuels, infrastructure, and clear regulatory guidance. According to hellenicshippingnews.com, the industry views the implementation timeframe as unreasonable, given the current state of alternative fuel availability and port infrastructure. The Draft Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) (Extension to Maritime Activities) Order 2026, was passed by the Commons on February 11th, adding further pressure to the industry who view this timeline as unreasonably short.

The core of the issue revolves around the readiness of the UK maritime sector for such a significant regulatory shift. Alternative fuels, crucial for decarbonization, reportedly cost four to five times more than conventional options. Furthermore, most UK ports lack the necessary shoreside electricity to power vessels while in port, hindering the adoption of electric or hybrid propulsion systems. Without addressing these fundamental challenges, the industry fears that the UK ETS will simply increase costs for passengers and freight without delivering substantial environmental benefits. This situation could potentially negatively impact [company rankings](/companies.html), particularly those operating predominantly within the UK.

## Calls for Revenue Ringfencing, Island Protections, and EU ETS Alignment

To mitigate the perceived negative impacts, the UK shipping industry is advocating for several key adjustments to the UK ETS. Central to their demands is the ringfencing of maritime ETS revenues for investments in shore power infrastructure, grid upgrades, vessel retrofits, and the development of clean fuels. This approach aligns with the principle of using carbon pricing revenue to directly support decarbonization efforts within the sector, mirroring arguments often made regarding the EU ETS.

Furthermore, the industry is seeking targeted protections for ferry-dependent and island communities. The absence of safeguards similar to those granted to Scottish islands under the EU ETS is a major point of contention. Without such protections, fare increases resulting from the ETS could disproportionately burden residents who rely on maritime transport for essential services and economic activity. The industry also strongly suggests aligning the UK ETS rules with those of the EU ETS to prevent double-charging and carbon leakage – issues that could undermine the effectiveness of both schemes. If the UK ETS rules are not aligned, vessels trading between the UK and the EU could face additional compliance burdens and costs, ultimately harming UK competitiveness.

## Compressed Preparation Period and Potential Diversion of Investment

The regulations were published on January 13th and are expected to come into force six months later. This has left industry leaders concerned as that timeline is too short to ensure operators finalise their emissions monitoring plans, hire verifiers, upgrade systems and forecast financial impacts on extremely tight timelines, without full guidance or clarity from Government. This hasty implementation raises concerns about the potential for unintended consequences, including the diversion of investment away from existing decarbonization projects. Companies may be forced to prioritize compliance with the ETS over longer-term investments in cleaner technologies and fuels.

This compressed timeline also places a significant burden on operators to develop and implement robust emissions monitoring plans, a crucial step in complying with both the UK ETS and the EU's MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) regulations, which are similar.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The UK shipping industry's pushback against the UK ETS expansion highlights the complex challenges of decarbonizing the maritime sector. While carbon pricing mechanisms like the ETS are intended to incentivize emissions reductions, their effectiveness hinges on careful design, adequate preparation, and supportive infrastructure. The industry's concerns about competitiveness, affordability, and the availability of alternative fuels are legitimate and warrant serious consideration. Failure to address these concerns could lead to unintended consequences, such as increased costs for essential services and a slowdown in the transition to a cleaner maritime industry. The success of the UK ETS, and its contribution to global shipping emissions reduction, depends on finding a balance between ambitious climate goals and the practical realities of the sector. Understanding the [CII ratings](/cii.html) of vessels will also become increasingly important in the context of the UK ETS, as vessels with lower ratings may face higher carbon costs.
