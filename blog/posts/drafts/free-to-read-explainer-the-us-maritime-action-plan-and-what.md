The White House's newly announced Maritime Action Plan (MAP) presents a potential shakeup for international shipping lines calling at US ports, with proposals that could significantly impact operating costs, cargo allocation, and, by extension, the industry's carbon footprint. While focused primarily on bolstering the US maritime sector, the plan's various measures, particularly new fees on foreign-built vessels, will have knock-on effects for emissions calculations, [CII ratings](/cii.html), and potentially even [company rankings](/companies.html) on sites like DirtiestShips.com.

## Universal Fee on Foreign-Built Vessels: A Carbon Cost Proxy?

The cornerstone of the MAP for international carriers is the proposed "universal infrastructure or security fee" on all foreign-built commercial vessels calling at US ports. The article cites illustrative figures of $0.01 per kg and $0.25 per kg of imported cargo, projecting revenues of $66 billion and $1.5 trillion over ten years, respectively. Given that nearly the entire global container fleet is foreign-built, this fee would function as a de facto surcharge on most international liner operators. While the primary purpose isn't emissions reduction, the fee could have an indirect impact.

The additional cost, especially at the higher $0.25/kg level, could incentivize carriers to optimize vessel utilization and routing to minimize port calls and cargo weight. More efficient operations directly translate to lower fuel consumption and reduced CO2 emissions. It's important to note that without specifics on how the fee will be implemented, it's difficult to predict the exact impact on individual companies and their [CII ratings](/cii.html). A flat fee, for instance, would penalize carriers of heavy goods disproportionately. However, any increase in operational costs, regardless of its origins, will likely push companies to further consider fuel-efficient technologies and practices to mitigate financial impact.

## Cargo Preference Rules: Reshaping Trade Lanes, Reshaping Emissions

The MAP also proposes tightening cargo preference rules, increasing the percentage of US government cargo that must move on US-flagged vessels and potentially requiring high-volume exporting economies to transport a larger share of US-bound containerized cargo on qualifying US vessels. This could redirect cargo away from existing global liner networks. The environmental consequence is not immediately obvious, but any forced changes to trade lanes and vessel utilization rates will have an impact on the emissions per transported ton.

If the rules favour smaller, potentially less efficient US-flagged vessels, the overall emissions intensity of US-bound cargo could even increase. Currently, DirtiestShips.com relies on data from the EU's Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system, collected by EMSA. As this regulation is specific to the US, it remains to be seen if data will be made accessible to track the changes in emissions patterns that could result from the MAP.

## Land Port Maintenance Tax: Leveling the Playing Field

To prevent cargo diversion via Canada or Mexico, the MAP proposes a 0.125% tax on goods entering through land ports, mirroring the existing Harbor Maintenance Fee. This aims to close loopholes allowing shippers to avoid maritime-related charges. By making land routes less attractive, the tax could lead to more cargo being transported by sea, potentially impacting overall shipping volumes and associated emissions. It's also worth noting that this measure could influence routing decisions for carriers subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), as the cost of carbon emissions within the EU may be a factor in deciding whether to use land or sea routes.

## Strategic Commercial Fleet: A Small Step Towards a Greener Fleet?

The plan's proposal to create a Strategic Commercial Fleet (SCF) of US-built, US-flagged vessels, supported financially for construction and operation, represents a direct subsidy to US carriers. This could lead to the introduction of newer, potentially more fuel-efficient vessels into certain trades. Whether this will reduce overall emissions will depend on the technology adopted by the SCF vessels. If the new vessels are built with the latest energy-efficient designs and technologies, it could lead to a decrease in emissions per ton-mile compared to older vessels in the global fleet. However, the limited scale of the SCF may mean that the impact will remain marginal.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The US Maritime Action Plan, while primarily focused on revitalizing the US maritime industry, carries potential implications for shipping emissions. While the direct impact is uncertain, measures like the universal fee on foreign-built vessels could incentivize efficiency gains, while cargo preference rules and the SCF could reshape trade lanes and fleet composition. It’s vital for companies to monitor these developments and adapt their strategies to mitigate potential cost increases and environmental impacts. DirtiestShips.com will continue to analyze data and report on how these changes affect [company rankings](/companies.html), [CII ratings](/cii.html), and the overall carbon footprint of the shipping industry, based on data as it becomes available, potentially from [emissions data](/charts.html) sources.
