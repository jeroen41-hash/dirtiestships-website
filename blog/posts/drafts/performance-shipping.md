Performance Shipping aims to deliver consistent long-term value through safe, efficient operation, and a forward-looking mindset. The company's public statements highlight its commitment to emissions reductions, regulatory compliance, and investment in a modern, environmentally efficient fleet. While the article does not provide specific emissions data, the statements underscore the growing importance of decarbonization in the tanker sector and the strategies being adopted to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations such as the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

## Fleet Renewal and Energy-Saving Technologies

Performance Shipping currently operates a fleet of twelve tanker vessels, with ten actively sailing and two newbuilds scheduled for delivery in early 2026 and early 2027. The company says its fleet renewal program demonstrates a commitment to sustainability (businessfocusmagazine.com). The focus on modernizing the fleet ties directly into improving [CII ratings](/cii.html) and reducing exposure to EU ETS carbon costs. Newer vessels typically achieve higher energy efficiency, leading to lower fuel consumption and reduced CO2 emissions.

Furthermore, Performance Shipping states it is installing energy-saving devices to improve hydrodynamic characteristics, enhance fuel efficiency, and measurably reduce emissions (businessfocusmagazine.com). Specific types of energy-saving devices aren't mentioned, but could include things like propeller boss cap fins or air lubrication systems. The article references the use of voyage optimization software and speed management practices, both of which are relatively low-cost ways to enhance vessel efficiency.

## Regulatory Compliance and Transparency

CEO Andreas Michalopoulos emphasizes Performance Shipping's proactive approach to navigating "increasingly complex environmental and regulatory requirements" (businessfocusmagazine.com). The company is investing in emissions-monitoring technologies to ensure transparent reporting in line with EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime regulations. This transparency is not only essential for compliance but also for building trust with charterers and investors who are increasingly scrutinizing the environmental performance of shipping companies.

The EU ETS, in particular, places a direct cost on CO2 emissions from ships calling at EU ports. FuelEU Maritime, commencing in 2025, sets progressively tightening limits on the greenhouse gas intensity of energy used onboard ships. Performance Shipping’s investments in emissions monitoring will be crucial for accurately tracking emissions and managing ETS costs.

## The Importance of People

The article highlights the crucial role of Performance Shipping's shore and sea staff in achieving the company's goals. Michalopoulos emphasizes the company's commitment to attracting, supporting, and retaining talented individuals through continuous training, open communication, and a focus on health and well-being. This investment in human capital is viewed as essential to delivering consistent results in a demanding industry.

While seemingly unrelated to emissions, a well-trained and motivated crew is more likely to operate vessels efficiently and implement energy-saving measures effectively. Furthermore, strong leadership and communication are critical for fostering a culture of environmental responsibility throughout the organization. It's a reminder that while technology plays a key role, people ultimately drive the performance of shipping companies.

## What this means for shipping emissions

Performance Shipping's narrative underscores the growing emphasis on environmental performance within the tanker sector. While the article does not provide specific emissions reduction targets or data, the company's investments in fleet renewal, energy-saving technologies, and emissions monitoring suggest a genuine commitment to reducing its environmental footprint. The need to comply with regulations like the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime is clearly a driving force behind these investments.
