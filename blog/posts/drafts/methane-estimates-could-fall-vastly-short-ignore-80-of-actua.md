Methane emissions associated with natural gas production and transportation may be significantly underestimated, calling into question the accuracy of current emissions inventories and the effectiveness of climate policies. A new study from McGill University suggests that current measurement systems could be missing a large percentage of actual emissions, with potentially severe implications for meeting global methane reduction targets.

## The Methane Measurement Gap: A Troubling Uncertainty

The McGill University study, detailed in a recent *Cell Reports Sustainability* paper, highlights a critical discrepancy in methane emission estimates from natural gas supply chains. According to researcher Sarah Jordaan, standard measurement systems may underestimate methane releases by as much as 23% or, alarmingly, overestimate them by up to 316%. Moreover, these calculations often exclude the significant emissions generated during the combustion of natural gas in power plants, which Jordaan estimates can represent up to 80% of the full life cycle emissions. This raises substantial concerns about the reliability of current emissions inventories used to inform policy and track progress toward methane reduction goals.

## Underestimated Emissions, Missed Targets?

The research suggests that even ambitious targets for methane reduction may be insufficient if the underlying data is flawed. While more than 160 countries have pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% this decade, the International Energy Agency (IEA) advocates for a 75% reduction, deeming it both affordable and economically beneficial due to the marketability of captured methane. The McGill study underscores the urgency of addressing the methane measurement gap. If emissions are significantly higher than reported, achieving even the more ambitious 75% reduction target by 2030 will require immediate and aggressive action from industry, potentially exceeding the pace of current regulatory developments, particularly in the United States.

## Shipping's Role in the Natural Gas Supply Chain

The McGill study specifically mentions the inclusion of "ocean shipping" in the scope of their new SLiNG-GHG model, which calculates both methane and CO2 releases. This is particularly relevant to DirtiestShips.com, as LNG carriers are a significant component of the global shipping fleet and, by extension, contribute to overall shipping emissions. Accurately accounting for methane leaks during LNG transportation, including potential venting and fugitive emissions, is critical for a comprehensive understanding of the shipping industry's environmental impact. The study acknowledges that existing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) models often fail to capture the full impact of the natural gas supply chain, particularly with the rise of fracking and LNG exports.

## Implications for EU Regulations and MRV

The study emphasizes the European Union's focus on ensuring that its Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) purchases have low embodied GHG emissions. The EU is implementing regulations that require measurement, reporting, verification, and mitigation (MRV) of emissions along the natural gas supply chain. However, if the underlying measurement methodologies are inaccurate, the EU's regulatory efforts may be undermined. This highlights the importance of robust and reliable data for the effective implementation of policies like the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which is increasingly relevant to shipping. The EU MRV data, as tracked by DirtiestShips.com, is only as good as the accuracy of the emissions data entered. Improvements to the measurement of methane in transit will be vital for accurate monitoring.

## The Need for Transparency and Open-Source Solutions

The McGill research team developed the SLiNG-GHG model as a "democratized," open-source tool to improve transparency and accessibility in emissions measurement. They found that existing LCA models are often unavailable, complex, difficult to verify, and plagued by discrepancies in industry data. The new model aims to provide a more accessible solution for policymakers and the public to assess climate pollution from natural gas supply chains. This focus on transparency and open-source solutions aligns with the principles of DirtiestShips.com, which seeks to provide data-driven insights into shipping emissions.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The potential underestimation of methane emissions in the natural gas supply chain has significant implications for the shipping industry. Inaccurate methane measurements could distort the true environmental impact of LNG carriers and hinder efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the sector. More reliable data is crucial for assessing the [CII ratings](/cii.html) of LNG-fueled ships and for calculating the carbon costs associated with the EU ETS. It also underscores the urgent need for improved monitoring and reporting of methane emissions across the entire maritime sector, including exploration of new methods for detection and mitigation.
