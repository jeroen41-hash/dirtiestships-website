The White House's recently announced Maritime Action Plan (MAP) presents potentially significant, albeit medium- to long-term, challenges and opportunities for international shipping lines calling at US ports, particularly those heavily reliant on foreign-built vessels. While primarily aimed at bolstering the US shipbuilding industry and reducing reliance on foreign entities, the plan's proposed measures could lead to altered operating costs, cargo allocation shifts, and adjustments to port routing, with a ripple effect on global shipping emissions. This warrants close monitoring, especially in the context of industry-wide efforts to decarbonize and comply with regulations like the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and [CII ratings](/cii.html).

## The Universal Fee: A Carbon Cost in Disguise?

The most direct impact on international shipping emissions could stem from the proposed "universal infrastructure or security fee" on all foreign-built commercial vessels calling at US ports, calculated by cargo weight. The illustrative figures provided in the plan – $0.01 per kg raising $66 billion over 10 years and $0.25 per kg raising $1.5 trillion over the same period (gcaptain.com) – underscore the potential financial magnitude. Since nearly the entire global container fleet is foreign-built, this fee would effectively function as a surcharge on most international liner operators.

This fee, while ostensibly for infrastructure and security, could indirectly act as a carbon pricing mechanism. Higher operational costs for less efficient, older vessels could incentivize operators to deploy newer, more fuel-efficient ships to US routes, potentially improving their [CII ratings](/cii.html) and reducing their overall emissions footprint. However, the lack of specific details on the actual fee rate and implementation timeframe leaves considerable uncertainty. It's crucial to analyze the potential impact on specific trade lanes and ship types, which we will track through our [emissions data](/charts.html) and [company rankings](/companies.html) as more details become available. Any cost increase will likely be passed on to consumers, potentially impacting demand.

## Cargo Preference Rules: Reshaping Trade Lanes

The MAP's proposal to tighten cargo preference rules, increasing the percentage of US government cargo moving on US-flagged vessels and potentially establishing a new "United States Maritime Preference Requirement" (USMPR) for high-volume exporting economies (gcaptain.com), could reshape trade lanes. This might divert some cargo away from established global liner networks and bolster US-flag operators, potentially introducing quota-like dynamics into certain tradelanes.

While the direct impact on overall shipping emissions might be less pronounced compared to the universal fee, such shifts could have localized effects. For instance, if cargo is redirected to less efficient US-flagged vessels, it could increase emissions per ton-mile for those specific routes. The proposal warrants attention, as any policies favouring less eco-friendly ships may undermine global efforts to reduce the sector's environmental impact.

## Land Port Maintenance Tax: Leveling the Playing Field

To prevent cargo diversion via Canada or Mexico, the MAP proposes a 0.125% tax on goods entering through land ports, mirroring the existing Harbor Maintenance Fee (gcaptain.com). This measure aims to eliminate the arbitrage opportunity for shippers routing cargo through alternative ports to avoid maritime-related charges. By leveling the playing field between sea and land entries, the plan seeks to ensure a more consistent application of fees across different modes of transport. This may mean shorter voyages for some vessels and therefore a smaller carbon footprint.

## Strategic Commercial Fleet (SCF): A Green Fleet or a Subsidy?

The proposal to create a Strategic Commercial Fleet (SCF) of internationally trading US-built, US-flagged vessels, supported financially for construction and operation (gcaptain.com), raises questions about its potential impact on shipping emissions. On one hand, if the SCF prioritizes the construction of modern, fuel-efficient vessels, it could contribute to reducing the overall carbon intensity of the US-flagged fleet. On the other hand, if the SCF primarily serves as a subsidy for existing operators without a strong emphasis on emissions reduction, it could potentially lead to a less efficient allocation of resources and a slower transition towards a greener fleet.

## What this means for shipping emissions

The US Maritime Action Plan presents a complex mix of potential benefits and risks for shipping emissions. While the plan's overall focus is on bolstering the US maritime industry, its various proposals could have far-reaching implications for international shipping lines, trade patterns, and the industry's ongoing decarbonization efforts. The "universal infrastructure or security fee" holds the potential to incentivize the deployment of more fuel-efficient vessels, but the actual impact will depend on the specific rate and implementation details. Similarly, the cargo preference rules and the Strategic Commercial Fleet initiative could either accelerate or hinder the transition towards a greener shipping industry, depending on the specific design and implementation of these measures. As the plan moves through the legislative process, it is essential to closely monitor its potential impact on shipping emissions and to advocate for policies that promote a sustainable and environmentally responsible maritime sector.
