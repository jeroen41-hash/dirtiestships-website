# Welcome to the DirtiestShips Blog

The shipping industry is responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet it remains one of the least visible polluters. With DirtiestShips.com, we set out to change that by making EU MRV emissions data accessible and transparent.

## Why a blog?

Our [News page](/news.html) collects the latest headlines on maritime emissions and decarbonization from across the web. This blog is different: here we will publish original analysis and commentary based on the data we track.

Expect posts about:

- **Data deep dives** — What does the latest EMSA MRV data actually tell us? Which ship types are improving and which are falling behind?
- **CII rating analysis** — How are Carbon Intensity Indicator ratings distributed across the fleet, and what do they mean in practice?
- **Company comparisons** — How do the largest shipping companies stack up against each other on emissions?
- **Regulatory updates** — Plain-language explainers when new EU or IMO rules affect shipping emissions.

## About the data

All data on this site comes from the [EU MRV Regulation](https://mrv.emsa.europa.eu/), which requires ships above 5,000 GT calling at EU/EEA ports to report their annual CO2 emissions. We process this data to calculate rankings, CII ratings, and comparisons.

Stay tuned for our first analysis post.
