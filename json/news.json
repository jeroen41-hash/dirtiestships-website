    "title": "America\u2019s New Maritime Plan Is Competing for the Wrong Century",
    "summary": "The U.S. Maritime Action Plan ignores the urgency of decarbonization, focusing instead on outdated 20th-century shipbuilding competitiveness. EU's FuelEU Maritime regulations, starting in 2025, will penalize ships for high lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity, while the U.S. lags. China's aggressive carbon pricing and electrification efforts further highlight the plan's inadequacy in addressing the shift towards low-carbon shipping.",
    "content": "Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.\n\nOr support our Kickstarter campaign!\n\nThe new U.S. Maritime Action Plan, available from the White House Maritime Insights page, is serious policy work. It acknowledges that American commercial shipbuilding has withered to less than 1% of global output and that only a handful of domestic yards can build large oceangoing vessels. It recognizes workforce shortages, fragmented procurement, and brittle supply chains. It calls for multiyear contracting, yard recapitalization, and supplier development. On its own terms, it is coherent. Its diagnosis of the situation is realistic, as far as it goes. The problem is not that the plan lacks effort. The problem is that it is trying to restore competitiveness using a 20th century framework in a shipping market that is already shifting under it.\n\nGlobal shipping economics are changing because energy architecture is changing. The European Union has incorporated maritime into its Emissions Trading System, phasing in coverage from 40% of emissions in 2024 to 100% by 2027. FuelEU Maritime imposes a declining lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity requirement on energy used on board ships beginning in 2025, tightening over time. The IMO\u2019s 2023 strategy sets a net-zero direction for international shipping by or around 2050, with indicative checkpoints of at least 20% (striving for 30%) by 2030 and at least 70% (striving for 80%) by 2040 versus 2008. The legally binding package to implement that direction, a global fuel standard paired with a pricing mechanism, has been delayed in negotiations, featuring strong U.S. opposition, but the direction remains and regional rules like the EU\u2019s are already forcing fleet and fuel decisions. China has strong domestic targets, a strengthening and broadening carbon price, is electrifying shipping, and building strong low-carbon fuel industrial ecosystems. These are not symbolic targets and actions. They attach cost to carbon intensity. A vessel trading into Europe or Asia will face a rising compliance bill if it burns fossil fuel in a conventional architecture. That cost will be embedded in charter rates, asset valuations, and financing decisions.\n\nBattery electric and hybrid propulsion are not moral statements. They are cost structure shifts. If a short sea vessel consumes 10 tons of marine fuel per day at $700 per ton, that is $7,000 per day in fuel. At 300 operating days per year, that is $2.1 million annually. If hybridization cuts fuel burn by 30%, that is $630,000 per year saved before accounting for carbon pricing exposure. If EU ETS adds an effective $100 per ton of CO2 on 3.1 tons of CO2 per ton of fuel, that is an added $310 per ton of fuel burned. On 10 tons per day, that is $3,100 per day or $930,000 per year. Hybridization that reduces fuel use by 30% reduces that exposure proportionally. The economics are not subtle.\n\nBattery system costs have fallen sharply, making most studies on the subject obsolete as I noted recently. Containerized battery energy storage systems are being procured in competitive markets at $80 to $150 per kWh for delivered modules at port. Gravimetric densities at the system level are in the range of 140 to 175 Wh/kg. A 10 MWh installation at $120 per kWh is a $1.2 million capital item. At 150 Wh/kg, that 10 MWh weighs about 67 tons. On a 5,000 ton vessel, that is about 1.3% of displacement. If that battery displaces fuel burn equivalent to 3 tons per day and operates 300 days per year, it offsets about 900 tons of fuel annually. At $700 per ton, that is $630,000 per year. The simple payback is under two years before carbon pricing and maintenance effects. Not every vessel pencils out that cleanly, but many inland and short sea segments are already within this range.\n\nThe new U.S. plan acknowledges innovation in automation and digital systems. It addresses autonomous vessels and regulatory modernization. It calls for improved procurement efficiency and better requirement definition. Those elements are aligned with current practice. What it does not do is treat energy architecture as a core competitiveness lever. There are no electrification targets for vessel classes. There is no integrated strategy for port electrification. There is no defined domestic industrial base for maritime power electronics, battery integration, or high capacity shore connection hardware. Energy appears as background modernization, not as the organizing principle of the next generation fleet.\n\nProtection is the dominant instrument in the plan. It proposes strengthening cargo preference rules and imposing fees on foreign built vessels entering U.S. ports. It calls for expanding U.S. flag tonnage and building a Strategic Commercial Fleet supported by federal funding. This is mid 20th century maritime doctrine. It assumes that domestic build origin is the foundation of security. In a world where lifecycle operating cost under carbon constraints determines asset value, that assumption is incomplete.\n\nThe productivity gap remains central. Large commercial vessels built in South Korea, Japan, or China often cost 2 to 4 times less per compensated gross ton than comparable U.S. builds. That gap reflects continuous production lines, supplier density, standardized designs, and yard automation. If a Korean yard can deliver a 3,000 TEU feeder for $40 million and a U.S. yard requires $120 million for similar tonnage, protection can force domestic procurement but it cannot erase the cost differential. If the $120 million vessel also carries higher fuel and carbon compliance exposure because its energy architecture lags, the lifecycle gap widens further.\n\nThe universal per kg fee proposal in the plan illustrates the risk. At 1\u00a2 per kg, a 20,000 kg container load would incur $200 in additional cost. On 10 million containers, that is $2 billion. At 25\u00a2 per kg, that same container would incur $5,000. On 10 million containers, that is $50 billion. These costs would not be absorbed by shipowners. They would flow through freight rates into food, electronics, appliances, and construction materials. If the purpose is to raise $66 billion over ten years at 1\u00a2 per kg, that $6.6 billion per year is a tax on trade. It does not improve yard productivity. It shifts costs, and not externally, but to American consumers. As James Carville helped then future President Clinton articulate, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d. This plan will take a long time to rebuild capacity and put the costs on voters who are already paying over $1,000 per year on average for new protectionist tariffs.\n\nEnergy transition is also a security issue. A hybrid coastal fleet that reduces liquid fuel consumption by 30% reduces exposure to supply disruption. Shore power allows vessels at berth to draw from domestic electricity rather than imported fuel. Maritime shipping fuels used in the United States are refined primarily from a mix of domestic crude oil and imports, with Canada by far the largest foreign supplier. In recent years, roughly 50% to 60% of U.S. crude oil imports have come from Canada, followed by smaller volumes from Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Colombia, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Gulf Coast refineries, which produce most U.S. marine bunker fuel and marine diesel, typically run blends of domestic shale crude and heavier imported grades, especially Canadian heavy crude, to optimize refinery configurations designed for high sulfur residual fuel and distillate production. Current US policy is antagonizing or actively overthrowing foreign sources of crude, and the global energy market is making them economically non-viable, creating a strategy energy risk for US shipping fuels. A fleet designed around flexible energy inputs is harder to constrain through fuel embargo or price spike. If security is the core justification for maritime policy, then energy architecture should be central, not peripheral.\n\nThe Jones Act is the structural variable shaping American maritime economics, as I\u2019ve returned to a few times. It requires U.S. built, U.S. owned, U.S. crewed vessels for domestic coastwise trade. It is not mentioned in the plan. Not once. This is not oversight. It is avoidance. A maritime revival plan that will not even name the rule that defines the domestic market is policy shadowboxing. If the Jones Act strengthens security and competitiveness, say so and defend it. If it distorts cost and slows modernization, confront it and reform it. Silence is not strategy. Refusing to engage directly with the Jones Act in a comprehensive maritime plan is intellectual cowardice.\n\nThe world market will not wait for American political comfort. A vessel ordered in 2026 will likely operate into the 2050s. If that vessel enters European waters in 2030, it will face ETS exposure and FuelEU intensity requirements. China is heading in that direction, having 700 TEU container ships operating domestically. If the ship\u2019s energy architecture is fossil heavy, it will carry a rising compliance burden over its life. Asset values reflect expected cash flow. Cash flow reflects operating cost. Operating cost increasingly reflects carbon intensity. These are mechanical relationships.\n\nIf the United States rebuilds yard capacity primarily to produce conventional fossil heavy tonnage, it risks creating a protected domestic niche that depends on preference rules and tariffs rather than export competitiveness. If it rebuilds yard capacity while integrating battery, hybrid, and shore power readiness as baseline design elements, it can compete in the emerging regulatory environment. The difference is not philosophical. It is economic.\n\nCompetitiveness in the 2030s maritime market will be defined by three variables. Build cost per ton. Lifecycle operating cost under carbon constraints. Regulatory compliance flexibility. The current plan addresses build cost partially through procurement reform and supplier development. It addresses lifecycle cost only indirectly. It does not address compliance flexibility in a structured way.\n\nAvoiding the energy transition question does not freeze the market. It shifts the cost to later years. Retrofitting hybrid systems onto ships not designed for them is more expensive than integrating them at build. Retrofitting shore connection systems onto vessels not designed with appropriate electrical architecture adds complexity. Building tonnage that requires future modification to remain competitive is not industrial strength. It is deferred liability.\n\nA serious competitiveness strategy would treat maritime battery integration, high power conversion, thermal management, and shore infrastructure as core industrial base components. It would tie federal procurement to energy performance metrics. It would set measurable goals for hybrid penetration in coastal and government fleets. It would align port infrastructure funding with vessel electrification timelines. It would address the Jones Act openly in the context of energy architecture and global competitiveness.\n\nThe United States might be able to rebuild shipbuilding capacity. It could modernize yards and train workers. It could protect domestic trade. But if it defines competitiveness using 20th century metrics while the rest of the world prices carbon and redesigns vessels around new energy systems, it will find itself defending a fleet that is structurally expensive to operate. It\u2019s also subject to the ongoing policy flipflops in the country. Industrial policy without energy realism is incomplete. Maritime security without energy architecture is fragile. Competitiveness built on insulation rather than adaptation will not endure.",

Stena Line anticipates an extra \u00a39 million annually, or \u00a315 per HGV, van and car. Despite industry claims of investment in sustainable ferries, reliance on carbon-intensive fuels persists, warranting scrutiny of actual emissions reductions.",
    "content": "Northern Ireland businesses are set to be hammered by a green tax which bosses fear will make them uncompetitive.\n\nA new tax on ferries to Northern Ireland, set to be introduced this summer, will swell freight rates \u2013 weighing on the economy and driving up prices.\n\nThe levy system, known as the emissions trading scheme (ETS), stands to increase shipping costs to the province by 6pc when it comes into force in July, according industry estimates.\n\nThe UK Chamber of Shipping said that will put more pressure on an economy where supply chain costs are already higher than the rest of the UK because of arrangements imposed under Brexit\u2019s Windsor Framework.\n\nIt said the tax will also add to the red tape foisted on business following the agreement, which placed Northern Ireland in the EU\u2019s single market for goods after Brexit.\n\nThe ETS scheme requires shipping firms to pay for their CO2 emissions as part of the Government\u2019s push to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nUnlike other ferry routes, Northern Ireland will not be exempt from the charges, even though 90pc of commercial and passenger traffic goes by sea.\n\nThe Chamber said ferry firms will most likely have to pass the additional charges on.\n\nStena Line, which operates ferries to Belfast from Liverpool, Heysham in Lancashire and Cairnryan in Scotland, estimates that the scheme will increase its costs by \u00a39m annually. That would average \u00a315 for every HGV, van and car.\n\nThe Chamber said an initial 50pc deduction to match the carbon charges on voyages between Britain and Republic of Ireland will provide little relief.\n\nThat is because exporters in Northern Ireland compete mostly with firms in Britain rather than the province\u2019s southern neighbour, to which they will be at a structural disadvantage.\n\nUK firms have already spent millions on some of the most sustainably designed ferries, including methanol and rotor sail propulsion, leaving no financially viable way forward, it claimed.\n\nThe Chamber said: \u201cThe sector supports the UK\u2019s climate goals, but cannot deliver meaningful emissions reduction without the necessary fuels, infrastructure, and clear guidance in place.\n\n\u201cPremature implementation risks higher costs for passengers and freight, with limited environmental gain. However, the Government is pressing ahead, leaving industry in an untenable position.\u201d\n\nThe trade group urged ministers to delay introduction of the scheme while further assessments are carried out and said the revenue raised should be ring-fenced for investment in clean fuels and quayside power connections.\n\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said that it is for ship operators to decide how much of the expense of the ETS scheme to pass on, and that consumers should not see significant costs.\n\nA spokesman said: \u201cPricing emissions is a cost-effective way to cut carbon emissions and encourage greener travel. We are working closely with industry on implementation.\u201d",

Freight levels remain supported by constrained tonnage supply, particularly in core export regions, though near-term direction will depend on fresh cargo flow and overall market activity.\n\nArabian Gulf and West African dirty freight markets are currently characterized more by holding firmness than a new surge. Market activity appears measured, with participants monitoring cargo flow developments before establishing stronger directional conviction.\n\nTrade Flow & Policy Developments\n\nThe freight market\u2019s direction is increasingly shaped by evolving crude trade patterns and emerging policy shifts.\n\nA potential trade agreement between the United States and India, expected by mid-March, is drawing market attention. While the direct impact on freight remains uncertain, any adjustments to tariff frameworks or sourcing incentives could affect crude procurement strategies and, in turn, tonne-mile demand.\n\nA gradual reconfiguration of global trade flows is already taking shape. Indian refiners have shown renewed openness toward Venezuelan crude following the resumption of exports. State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) have jointly secured 2 million barrels, marking the second Venezuelan cargo deal since export channels reopened.\n\nIf sustained, this shift could modestly extend average voyage distances, particularly if Atlantic Basin crude gains an incremental share in Asian refining systems.\n\nHowever, structural realignment remains conditional. Commercial viability, refinery configuration constraints, and regulatory clarity continue to limit rapid substitution between crude grades. Not all barrels are interchangeable.\n\nSanctions frameworks and compliance requirements remain operational variables, particularly for vessel services, insurance, and financing channels.\n\nFor now, freight performance appears more directly driven by regional vessel availability and cargo timing rather than immediate geopolitical catalysts.\n\nFreight Market Overview \u2013 Dirty\n\nBaltic Dirty Tanker Index is trending exceptionally higher (+90% YoY), surpassing the monthly levels of the previous years since 2023.\n\nBDTI \u2013 Baltic Dirty Tanker Index Market Prices \u2192\n\nBDTI\n\nDirty TCE$/DAY\n\nVLCC | Suezmax | Aframax \u2193\n\nTD3C Middle East Gulf to China | TD6 Black Sea to Mediterranean | TD7 North Sea to Continent\n\nDirty Spot Price Summary Open in Platform \u2192\n\nDirty Spot Price Summary\n\nThe freight market pulse has eased further since the start of the first week of February. Yet strong performances are still recorded in the VLCC Middle East Gulf-to-China TCE and the Suezmax Black Sea-to-Mediterranean, with TCE in excess of $110k/d, while the Aframax North Sea-to-Continent dropped below $95k/d.\n\nVLCC: The TCE rates for the MEG-to-China route, while dropping by about $5,000/day to $117,000/day, remained strong. This $117k/d figure represents a substantial increase of roughly $83,000/day compared to a year ago.\n\nSuezmax: Rates for the Black Sea to Mediterranean route experienced a minor downward adjustment this week, remaining near $117k/day \u2014 an increase of approximately $79k/day YoY.\n\nAframax: North Sea-to-Continent rates currently stand at $93k/d, dropping by around $3k/day from the previous week, and still significantly weaker than the extraordinary spike to approximately $140k/d recorded just before the end of January.\n\nBaltic Rates Comparison \u2013 Dirty Spot Comparison \u2192\n\nDirty Rates\n\nFreight Market Overview \u2013 Clean\n\nBaltic Clean Tanker Index (+34% YoY).

Specifically, the latest Signal Ocean Platform figures indicate an oversupplied market on the TD22 route (24% above the 3-month average). This elevated supply level appears to be already restraining any further spike in recent freight market indications.\n\nWest Africa: The spike in the availability of spot/relet vessels on the TD15 route, which saw the count peak near 20 over the last fortnight, has now subsided. The vessel count has dropped to 13, helping TD15 rates maintain a floor above WS 120.\n\nAG: The sustained downward trajectory in net vessel supply within the Arabian Gulf region remains a notable market feature. Current data indicate a substantial reduction in the vessel count, now approximately 45% below the peak level recorded at the end of December 2025. This significant decline has accelerated recently, in contrast to the 26% decrease observed just before the close of the previous week.\n\nSuezmax | WAfr Vs Black Sea\n\nWAF Supply vs Demand \u2013 TD20 Open in Platform \u2192\n\nSuezmax WAF Supply\n\nWest Africa: Spot/relet vessels on the TD20 route are maintaining levels above 30 (the same as a week ago), marking a significant 100% rise from the exceptionally low figures recorded in mid-January. In addition, the current TSOP data indicate that the TD20 route is now oversupplied (23% above the 3-month average), which is expected to further depress freight demand.\n\nBlack Sea: Current volatility continues, averaging around 25 vessels, down from the peak of just over 30 vessels recorded in mid-November 2025.\n\nDirty Demand \u2013 Tonne Miles\n\nVLCC \u2193 3.3% WoW | Suezmax \u2191 2.8% WoW | Aframax \u2193 6.0% WoW\n\nTonne Miles Index View \u2013 7D MA Open in Platform \u2192\n\nDirty Demand\n\nThe VLCC segment\u2019s tonne-mile index growth stayed below 100%, in line with last week\u2019s expectations, continuing to lag both Suezmax and Aframax.

    "content": "The shipping industry's biggest players are shrugging off Trump administration opposition to a global carbon price and are forging ahead with billions of dollars in emissions-reducing investments, according to company officials and a Reuters analysis of data.\n\nEurope, Brazil and a host of other nations are pushing the sector, which is responsible for nearly 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, to go green. But, in October, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, the world's two largest oil producers, successfully spearheaded efforts to postpone by one year a decision on the International Maritime Organization's proposal of a $380-per-metric-ton levy.\n\nSome analysts and industry observers initially warned that the absence of such a global framework added complexity to companies' planning and could cause some to pause their green investments.\n\nBut in interviews with 15 shipping companies, ports, bunker suppliers and marine technology companies, 10 told Reuters that regional regulations, long investment lead times, and expectations of a continuing trend towards decarbonisation all argued in favour of staying the course.\n\nAnd a Reuters analysis of vessel delivery data through 2028 showed orders of ships capable of running on alternative fuels dominating new shipbuilding.\n\nHakan Agnevall - chief executive of Wartsila WRT1V.HE, a major producer of ship engines and exhaust gas cleaning scrubbers - told Reuters that a one-year carbon price postponement is unlikely to rattle customers, like his, who generally take a 30-year investment perspective.\n\n\"It's not bold to say that regulations will change during those 30 years.\"\n\nNew Ship Orders Dominated by Dual Fuel\n\nMost of the nearly 50,000 commercial ships operating globally today run on fuel oil or gas oil. But in a unanimous decision in 2023, IMO member states set a target of net-zero emissions by or around 2050.\n\nFirms have, in anticipation, begun ordering dual-fuel ships that can use both fuel oil as well as greener alternatives like liquefied natural gas, methanol and ammonia.\n\nWhile Pacific Basin - a large dry bulk ship owner - did opt to buy four newbuild vessels running only on oil-derived fuels, citing the postponement of the IMO's carbon price, the company is an outlier.\n\nUnlike other sectors - from energy to auto manufacturing - that have curbed their green ambitions in a rollback that has only accelerated since Donald Trump's return to the White House, the shipping industry has, so far, declined to pivot.\n\nMajor ship owners have reiterated their commitments to invest in emissions reduction measures, including dual-fuel vessels and onboard energy-saving devices.\n\nBy the end of December, companies had invested over $150 billion in dual-fuel vessels, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the World Shipping Council, an industry group for container shipping and vehicle carriers.\n\nIn total, 1,126 dual-fuel container ships and vehicle carriers have now been either delivered or are on order, the data showed. That marks an increase of 28% compared with the previous year, indicating that newbuilding orders for lower-emission fuel vessels continued even after the IMO delay.\n\nThey also continued to outpace orders for traditional ships, with dual-fuel vessels now accounting for 74% of the overall container ship and vehicle carrier orderbook.\n\nAnd investments in new marine fuels are also moving ahead.\n\nAlexander Saverys, CEO of Belgian ship owner CMB.Tech, told Reuters it will continue investments in both ammonia bunkering and production.\n\nA Mitsui O.S.K. Lines spokesperson told Reuters the IMO postponement just means a longer transition to low and zero-carbon fuels, and the company is still focused on LNG-fuelled vessels and early-stage adoption of ammonia and methanol.\n\nMaersk, among the first to explore emissions-reducing alternative fuels, initially opted for methanol but has since ordered LNG-fuelled ships and has now also started testing ethanol as an alternative.\n\nNYK Group 9101.T, which reaffirmed its emissions reduction strategy after the IMO decision, sees the one-year delay as an opportunity for discussion and refinement of the regulatory framework, a company spokesperson said.\n\n\"While recent regulatory uncertainties might lead some operators to take a more cautious approach, the overall direction of maritime decarbonisation has not changed significantly,\" said Jason Stefanatos, decarbonisation director at maritime consultancy DNV.\n\n\"The commercial drivers still remain.\"\n\nGreen Incentives Continue\n\nMany companies cited regional green fuel regulations among the main reasons for moving ahead with investments.\n\nThe European Union's FuelEU Maritime, which requires vessels to pay penalties for failing to achieve lower emissions, makes a business case for greener fleets, ship owners and fuel suppliers said. And the EU Emissions Trading System and voluntary initiatives provide further incentives.\n\nShip owners with dual-fuel vessels will likely use them on EU voyages to avoid paying FuelEU Maritime penalties, and some should also receive rewards for over-compliance, said Kenneth Tveter, an analyst at shipbroker Clarksons.\n\n\"The case for low-carbon fuels such as ammonia and methanol is still alive if you have a trade concentrated around Europe,\" he said.\n\nMajor Horn of Africa port Djibouti and OPEC member Gabon have also introduced levies on maritime emissions.\n\nAnd current momentum could see punitive regulations and incentive schemes introduced in other important shipping hubs soon.\n\nBritain, notably, has proposed to expand its emissions trading system to international shipping from 2028. And Turkey is considering a scheme similar to the EU's.\n\nSuch factors should drive demand for LNG, bio-LNG and biofuels over the next five years, said Nacho de Miguel, head of alternative fuels at bunker supplier Peninsula.\n\n\"Whilst the IMO's net-zero framework has been postponed, this does not change our strategy,\" he said.",

    "content": "BAR Technologies is urging immediate action toward a unified global carbon framework, warning that the proliferation of regional emissions trading schemes is placing unprecedented compliance pressure on the maritime sector and risks delaying progress on decarbonisation.\n\nWith multiple overlapping schemes now in effect or emerging, including the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, the IMO\u2019s postponed Net-Zero Framework, and proposed Greenhouse gas Fuel Intensity (GFI) measures, shipowners are increasingly navigating a maze of conflicting obligations. According to the International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP), over 30 emissions trading systems are now either in force or under development worldwide. This pattern of fragmentation reflects a broader global challenge: recent research from the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics identified over 900 climate adaptation laws and policies adopted across 35 countries since the Paris Agreement. While this surge signals growing ambition, it also highlights the risks of uncoordinated frameworks that lead to implementation gaps, increased costs and regulatory friction across borders.\n\n\u201cCarbon compliance is becoming more fragmented by the month,\u201d said John Cooper, CEO of BAR Technologies. \u201cInstead of building momentum behind a single global framework, we\u2019re creating a patchwork of schemes with different baselines, rules and cost mechanisms. That creates confusion, inflates costs, and weakens the industry\u2019s ability to invest in real, scalable solutions.\u201d\n\nThe situation is further complicated by mechanisms such as the EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which went live on 1 January 2026. While not directly taxing shipping emissions, CBAM introduces indirect carbon costs into the trade system by pricing the embedded emissions of goods such as steel, aluminium, cement, and fertilisers, all of which are major seaborne cargoes.\n\n\u201cCBAM is an example of how carbon pricing is now embedded into trade,\u201d Cooper noted. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a reminder that without multilateral alignment, we risk policy friction and commercial uncertainty on a global scale.\u201d\n\nTo avoid paralysis through bureaucracy, BAR Technologies is calling for a single carbon policy, one that is globally agreed, fairly administered and financially transparent. The company continues to advocate for a bunker-level collection mechanism to fund climate-positive reinvestment, while avoiding the duplication and complexity of overlapping schemes.\n\n\u201cWhile we await consensus on a unified framework, we cannot afford inaction,\u201d Cooper continued. \u201cWe need technologies that work today, across regulatory zones and wind propulsion is leading that charge.\u201d\n\nBAR Technologies\u2019 WindWings\u00ae, already deployed on multiple vessels, offer immediate fuel savings and emissions reductions. Beyond near-term impact, they enhance the viability of alternative fuels like methanol and ammonia by reducing overall fuel demand.\n\n\u201cWind doesn\u2019t need permission,\u201d said Lauren Eatwell, Head of WindWings\u00ae at BAR Technologies. \u201cIt\u2019s scalable, proven, and will be around forever. The industry has an opportunity to act now and lead, not wait to be regulated into action.\u201d",

    "content": "The UK shipping industry has raised serious concerns over Government plans to extend the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) to domestic maritime from 1 July 2026, warning that the policy risks harming UK competitiveness, increasing costs for island communities and slowing progress towards net zero.\n\nOn Wednesday 11 February, the Draft Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) (Extension to Maritime Activities) Order 2026, to extend the UK ETS to domestic maritime was passed by the Commons, following limited Parliamentary scrutiny and despite broad-reaching concerns.\n\nA spokesperson for the UK Chamber of Shipping said:\n\nThe sector supports the UK\u2019s climate goals, but cannot deliver meaningful emissions reduction without the necessary fuels, infrastructure, and clear guidance in place \u2013 and unreasonable timeframes to implement flawed policy.\n\nPremature implementation risks higher costs for passengers and freight, with limited environmental gain. However, Government is pressing ahead, despite concerns from several quarters, leaving industry in an untenable position.\n\nTo ensure the scheme is both workable and fair, the industry has urged further scrutiny of the measures and called for:\n\nRingfencing maritime ETS revenues for shore power, grid upgrades, retrofits and clean fuels.\n\nTargeted protections for ferry\u2011dependent and island communities.\n\nAlignment with EU ETS rules to avoid double\u2011charging and carbon leakage.\n\nA phased or \u201cmonitor\u2011only\u201d period until operators and ports have the systems required for compliance.\n\nIndustry representatives warn that the UK does not yet have viable fuel alternatives or the port energy capacity required to support low\u2011carbon operations. Alternative fuels currently cost four to five times more than conventional options, and most UK ports lack the shoreside electricity needed to power vessels in port.\n\nWithout Government reinvestment of ETS revenues, the scheme risks raising costs rather than driving emissions reduction.\n\nConcerns are particularly acute for island and lifeline ferry routes, where fare increases would disproportionately affect residents who rely on maritime transport for essential services, food supply and economic activity.\n\nDespite clear precedents such as protections for Scottish islands under the EU ETS, equivalent safeguards have not been committed for the UK.\n\nThe sector is also facing a compressed preparation period. The regulations were published on 13 January and come into force just six months later, requiring operators to finalise emissions monitoring plans, hire verifiers, upgrade systems and forecast financial impacts on extremely tight timelines, without full guidance or clarity from Government.\n\nIndustry warns this could divert investment away from decarbonisation projects already underway.\n\nThe Chamber is urging Government to:",

A spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said fire fighters had been battling the blaze for eight hours, and were facing major challenges due to a lack of resources.\n\nIt also said a number of people had to be treated for smoke inhalation.\n\nFootage shows collision between two US Navy ships in Caribbean Sea\n\nThomas Copeland\n\nBBC Verify Live journalist\n\nWe\u2019ve just verified two videos showing a collision between two US Navy ships on Wednesday.\n\nTwo people reported minor injuries after the incident involving the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Truxtun and Supply-class combat support ship USNS Supply.\n\nThe US military's Southern Command confirmed to the BBC the collision took place during an at-sea refuelling operation and both ships were able to continue safely afterwards.\n\nShip-tracking site MarineTraffic shows USNS Supply last broadcast its position on Thursday where it was docked at the port of Ponce in the US territory of Puerto Rico.\n\nSouthern Command said the incident was under investigation.\n\nBoth videos were taken aboard USNS Supply and we\u2019ve been able to match key features on the vessels to publicly available images. These included the forward gun and hull number on USS Truxtun and the cranes, hoses and steps on USNS Supply.\n\nReverse images searches indicate that neither of these videos appeared online before yesterday.\n\nHow might Trump\u2019s climate rollback affect US emissions?\n\nMark Poynting\n\nBBC Verify researcher\n\nThe US is currently the second-biggest emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide - but its emissions have generally been falling over the past two decades. Many analysts say this is partly due to the \u201cendangerment finding\u201d made in 2009 when Barack Obama was president.\n\nThis concluded that greenhouse gases were a risk to public health - and was reversed by President Donald Trump yesterday.\n\nThe endangerment finding underpinned US efforts to cut emissions in transport, power stations and industry, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe consequences of Trump\u2019s move for US emissions - and global climate change - are uncertain.\n\nPrevious modelling by independent researchers at Rhodium Group suggested rolling back US climate regulations would slow - but not reverse - emissions cuts.\n\nIt also appears unlikely that US car manufacturers will abandon all carbon-cutting efforts as they sell to other markets like the EU that have their own emissions rules.\n\n\u201cAmerican gas-guzzlers aren't popular abroad, and allowing them to become more polluting will further lessen their appeal,\u201d said Chris Aylett, research fellow at Chatham House\u2019s Environment and Society Centre.\n\nThe US Alliance for Automotive Innovation welcomed yesterday\u2019s announcement but said the industry would stay \u201con a long-term path of emissions reductions and cleaner vehicles\u201d.\n\nAccusations of Bangladesh election rigging circulate online without evidence\n\nShruti Menon and Shyadul Islam\n\nBBC Verify and BBC Bangla\n\nWe\u2019ve been monitoring Bangladesh\u2019s landmark elections for evidence of misinformation and false posts online.\n\nNow the outcome is clear - a landslide victory for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party - we\u2019ve continued to look online for social posts challenging the validity of the results and scrutinising the evidence presented.\n\nOne in particular has caught our eye - which is being widely shared on Facebook and X - that claims to show evidence of vote rigging.\n\nIt shows a voter tally sheet at one counting station with crossed-out figures suggesting the results were changed after first being recorded.\n\nWe contacted the election duty officer whose signature appears on the sheet. He confirmed this was a genuine voter tally sheet and the corrections were a result of a clerical error while recording the vote.\n\nA later version of the sheet was submitted without the strikethroughs, he said.\n\nWe can\u2019t say whether the alterations on this occasion were made as a result of manipulation or clerical error, but this post has clearly led to speculation about the conduct of the election on Bengali-language social media.\n\nHow much do Nato members spend on defence?\n\nAnthony Reuben\n\nBBC Verify senior journalist\n\nThe annual Munich Security Conference gets under way in Germany today - and is due to hear from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio tomorrow.\n\nRubio\u2019s appearance follows recent tensions between the US and its Nato allies after President Donald Trump threatened Danish sovereignty with a pledge to annex Greenland.\n\nSpeaking to reporters as he left, Rubio insisted the US wasn't abandoning Europe, but said it should learn to defend itself.\n\nWhile the US defence budget has come down from 3.6% of its GDP in 2020 to an estimated 3.2% in 2025, spending by the rest of Nato, external - Canada and the European members - has gone up from 1.7% of their combined GDP in 2020 to an estimated 2.3% in 2025.\n\nHowever in cash terms, the US is still by far the biggest spender on defence, spending about $980bn (\u00a3720bn) last year, which was 62% of the Nato total.\n\nMembers are now committed to spending, external 3.5% of GDP on defence by 2035, with another 1.5% going on things like protecting critical infrastructure and ensuring civil preparedness.\n\nTrump\u2019s climate comments at odds with overwhelming scientific consensus\n\nMark Poynting\n\nBBC Verify researcher\n\nOn Thursday US President Donald Trump revoked a landmark Obama-era ruling that greenhouse gases \u2013 such as carbon dioxide and methane \u2013 endanger public health.\n\n\u201cThis determination had no basis, in fact, had none whatsoever,\u201d he said, later adding that the ruling had \u201cnothing to do with public health\u201d.\n\nDiana Furchtgott-Roth \u2013 who served in the first Trump administration \u2013 defended the move, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme \u201charms from climate change are risks for the future\u201d.\n\nBoth claims run contrary to the overwhelming scientific consensus on the causes and impacts of climate change.\n\n\u201cHuman activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming,\u201d states the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), external.\n\nIts reports are signed off by governments around the world as an accurate reflection of the science.\n\nRather than being risks for the future, the IPCC says, external human-caused climate change \u201cis already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe\u201d, such as heatwaves or heavy rainfall events.\n\nThe IPCC adds, external that human-caused climate change \u2013 driven by greenhouse gas emissions - has \u201cadversely affected the physical health of people globally\u201d through extreme heat and climate-related diseases.\n\nHow many TfL stations in London have signs in foreign languages?\n\nLucy Gilder\n\nBBC Verify journalist\n\nDuring his interview on the BBC\u2019s Political Thinking podcast, Reform UK\u2019s Nigel Farage said: \u201cIf you go to parts of east London\u2026 you see London Underground stations with foreign languages next to them.\u201d\n\nIn response to a 2025 Freedom of Information (FOI) request Transport for London (TfL) referenced two stations in the capital with dual-language signs, external.\n\nOne is Southall in west London which has Punjabi signage and the other is Whitechapel, east London, which has signs in Bengali.\n\nTfL said the Bengali sign was added to Whitechapel station following a request from the mayor of Tower Hamlets borough.\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said on X at the time, external that the signage was about \u201crecognising and celebrating the vital contribution Bangladeshi Londoners have made shaping the Tower Hamlets community\u201d.\n\nTfl says the Southall Punjabi signs were there before it took over the station which is now part of the Elizabeth Line.\n\nIn the same FOI answer, TfL responded \u201cno\u201d when asked if it had plans for more stations to be bilingual.\n\nBBC Verify has asked TfL whether any more dual-language signs have been added to its stations since it provided that FOI response last year.\n\nSudanese army destroys paramilitary air defence system\n\nPeter Mwai and Richard Irvine-Brown\n\nBBC Verify\n\nVideo has emerged showing the moment a Sudanese army drone struck an air defence system used by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the Kordofan region of southern Sudan earlier this week.\n\nAlthough images claiming to show the destroyed Chinese-made FK-2000 system first appeared on social media on 10 February, the video published yesterday by the state news agency, tells us more about the attack.\n\nIn the last frames of the video we can make out the FK-2000 - its launching and transport platforms, plus its radars - before the camera cuts out.\n\nWe were able to match the long straight dirt track near a river bed, a small group of houses and what looks like a reservoir so we could confirm the strike was 3 miles (5km) west of al-Debeibat - a town people have mentioned on Sudanese social media as being close to the attack.\n\nThis puts it in the heart of the fighting between the government\u2019s forces and RSF in the region. Both sides have been fighting a civil war across Sudan for almost three years.\n\nAnd we can be confident the attack was on 10 February because satellite images from that day show scrub burning at the same place.\n\nAnalysing footage of Russian strikes on Ukraine\n\nPaul Brown\n\nBBC Verify senior journalist\n\nWe've been reviewing footage following overnight attacks on Ukraine which local officials say have killed at least six people across the country.\n\nThe strikes reportedly targeted Odesa, Kramatorsk and Zaporizhzhia, and involved one missile and 154 drones, according to the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\nFootage filmed this morning in the city of Odesa shows widespread damage to a car dealership, where one building has been almost completely blown out, and a number of vehicles destroyed.\n\nAmong the vehicles seen in the video were Mitsubishis and Peugeots which meant we could narrow down our search for where the attack happened to the location of these dealerships.\n\nAt one point the video offers a very similar angle on the Peugeot showroom to one seen in a photograph on the outlet's official website.\n\nWelcome to BBC Verify\n\nRob Corp\n\nBBC Verify Live editor\n\nGood morning.\n\nWe start today by fact-checking claims made by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage about immigration.\n\nFarage posted a video on X yesterday, following comments made by billionaire Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, where the Reform UK leader wrote: \u201cJim Ratcliffe is right\u201d.\n\nIn the video he claims that \u201cone million people living in this country don\u2019t speak any English at all\u201d. He\u2019s wrong, and we\u2019ll bring you more shortly on what we know.\n\nElsewhere, there\u2019s been another night of drone and missile attacks across Ukraine. At least six people were killed across the country, according to officials. We\u2019re verifying footage showing the aftermath of one attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to tell European leaders the continent must learn to defend itself when he visits the Munich Security Conference which gets under way today. We\u2019re looking at what Europe\u2019s Nato members spend on defence.",

    "content": "Subscribe to our free newsletter today to keep up to date with the latest transportation and logistics news.\n\nA 130 metre vessel has quietly shifted the trajectory of commercial maritime transport. Hull 096, built by Incat Tasmania, began harbour trials on the River Derwent, becoming the largest battery electric ship ever to move under its own propulsion.\n\nThe milestone marks the first time a vessel of this scale and passenger vehicle capacity has operated solely on battery power. For an industry under mounting pressure to decarbonise, the significance extends far beyond southern Australia.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment where the ship truly comes alive,\u201d Incat Chairman Robert Clifford said as the vessel undertook its first controlled movements. \u201cMoving Hull 096 under its own battery electric power is a world first at this scale and confirms that electric propulsion is viable for large commercial vessels.\u201d\n\nThe harbour trials signal the transition from construction to operational testing, a phase that will determine how convincingly electric propulsion can perform in real world commercial conditions.\n\nTesting the limits of large scale electric propulsion\n\nHarbour trials are a structured process. Crews test propulsion systems, manoeuvrability, control integration and onboard operational performance. For Hull 096, those tests carry added scrutiny. Scaling battery systems to power a vessel of 130 metres represents a technical leap for shipbuilders accustomed to diesel driven ferries and hybrid systems.\n\nUnlike smaller electric craft that operate on short commuter routes, Hull 096 is designed for significant passenger and vehicle throughput. Its propulsion system must deliver not only emissions free movement but also reliability, redundancy and performance consistent with commercial ferry operations.\n\nEngineers will evaluate how propulsion and steering respond under varying loads, how energy management systems balance power demand, and how onboard systems interact when running entirely on battery supply. The objective is not symbolic success but operational proof.\n\nElectric propulsion at this size requires extensive battery capacity, advanced power management and thermal control systems capable of sustaining high output without compromising safety. The trials will test those systems in dynamic harbour conditions where wind, current and vessel traffic introduce variables that static dockside testing cannot replicate.\n\nThe fact that the vessel has now moved under its own stored energy demonstrates that large scale electrification is no longer theoretical. It is operational.\n\nA signal to a decarbonising maritime industry\n\nShipping accounts for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions, and regulators and cargo owners alike are pressing operators to accelerate decarbonisation. While alternative fuels such as methanol and ammonia remain under development, battery electric propulsion offers a commercially available pathway for specific routes, particularly high frequency ferry services.\n\nHull 096 represents a case study in how established shipbuilders are adapting to that shift. Incat Tasmania has long specialised in fast ferries. The move toward full electrification reflects both technological maturity and market demand.\n\nThe vessel is scheduled for delivery to South America following completion of its testing and commissioning program. That deployment will place one of the most advanced electric ships into an operational environment where passenger transport volumes and environmental expectations continue to rise.\n\nFor operators, the economic equation is central. Electric vessels promise lower fuel costs over time, reduced maintenance complexity compared with internal combustion engines and insulation from fossil fuel price volatility. However, those advantages must offset the upfront capital required for battery systems and charging infrastructure.\n\nThe harbour trials therefore serve not only as a technical milestone but also as a commercial signal. If Hull 096 performs as expected, it strengthens the case for electric propulsion in larger classes of vessels.\n\nThe broader implication is competitive. Shipyards that demonstrate competence in battery integration and electric system management will be positioned to capture a growing share of new build contracts as environmental regulation tightens.\n\nFor now, the River Derwent has become a proving ground. The sight of a 130 metre vessel moving silently under battery power may appear incremental to casual observers. Within boardrooms and design offices across the maritime sector, it will be read as evidence that the electrification of large commercial vessels has moved from ambition to application.\n\nSources",

    "summary": "Trump's Maritime Action Plan aims to revitalize US shipbuilding, which currently produces less than 1% of commercial vessels. The plan proposes vessel fees and zones, but its success hinges on Congressional funding. Without real investment, this \"plan\" will fail to reduce reliance on foreign-flagged ships and their emissions.",
    "content": "America builds under 1% of commercial ships. The White House Maritime Action Plan bets on vessel fees, a trust fund, and zones, but Congress is the clock.\n\nBy Captain John Konrad (gCaptain) The United States builds less than one percent of the world\u2019s commercial ships. Eleven shipyards have active build positions. Eight can build vessels over 400 feet. The supply base has consolidated to the point where many critical components come from a single supplier. And virtually all of America\u2019s oceangoing trade, the goods that stock shelves, fuel refineries, and supply factories from coast to coast, moves on foreign-built, foreign-crewed, foreign-flagged vessels.\n\nTrump\u2019s Maritime Action Plan (MAP), released today, is the most ambitious attempt to reverse that decline since the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. It was supposed to arrive 100 days ago. The maritime executive order President Trump signed on April 9, 2025, gave his team 210 days, a November deadline, to deliver the strategy. It took 310. The delay itself tells you something about the scale of what they\u2019re attempting. The MAP is 35 pages. It is substantive. And it was signed not by the Secretary of Transportation, but by Marco Rubio as National Security Advisor and Russell Vought as OMB Director, which tells you how the administration sees this: not as transportation policy, but as a matter of national survival.\n\n\u201cWe will soon revitalize our once-great shipyards with hundreds of billions of dollars in new investments and people coming from all around the world\u2026to build ships in America,\u201d said President Trump in the introduction to the plan. \u201cWe want them built in America.\u201d\n\nBut a plan is not a shipyard. And the distance between the two is measured in years, billions of dollars, and the willingness of Congress to actually fund what the White House is proposing.\n\nThis plan is dense, it\u2019s well written, it has real value but agencies like the Maritime Administration are seriously under staffed while others, like the Navy\u2019s NAVSEA are increadibly bloated so the question remains is it too ambitious? And if it all can be accomplish\u2026 how long will it take?\n\nWhat the Plan Actually Does\n\nThe MAP is organized around four pillars, but the real story is a handful of policy tools that, if enacted, would fundamentally change the economics of American shipbuilding. The document\u2019s stated objective is worth quoting: not merely to grow the number of vessels built in the United States, but to reconstitute a maritime industrial base capable of self-sustained production. That distinction matters. This is not a subsidy program to build a few more ships. It is an attempt to rebuild an entire industrial ecosystem, shipyards, suppliers, workforce, design capacity, that can sustain itself once the federal scaffolding comes down. As I said, it\u2019s ambitious.\n\nThree things stand out about the MAP\u2019s approach. First, the sheer scale of proposed government investment and intervention\u2026 two things Republicans have traditionally avoided. Second, the interagency and allied coordination required to execute it, this plan reaches across OMB, NSC, Maritime Administration (MARAD), the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, Commerce, State, Treasury and foreign governments simultaneously. Third, pages of deregulatory actions: a large section of this plan is dedicated to eliminating outdated rules, streamlining compliance, clarifying policies, reducing mandatory able seaman billet requirements, and revising merchant mariner training standards rooted in the IMO\u2019s STCW convention. The MAP wants to cut red tape as aggressively as it spends money, and the deregulatory sections are among the most detailed in the document.\n\nThe industrial strategy is equally specific. The MAP calls for multi-year, multi-vessel procurement to give shipyards predictable order books. It pushes modular production, digital engineering and AI. It demands that performance requirements and ship design packages be fully developed before production begins, and that commercially available designs be used wherever possible. The metric it uses is revealing: reduce time to part and time to hull. That\u2019s not bureaucratic language. That\u2019s manufacturing language. And it signals an administration that understands shipbuilding is an industrial problem, not a policy problem.\n\nThe most consequential is a proposed fee on every foreign-built vessel entering a U.S. port, assessed by the weight of imported tonnage. At one cent per kilogram, the plan estimates this could generates roughly $66 billion over ten years. At 25 cents per kilogram, it approaches $1.5 trillion. That 23x range tells you this is a negotiating position, not a final number, but where the administration lands within it will determine whether the entire plan has a financial engine or just an aspiration. And it\u2019s unclear if they can do it alone or will need cooperation from Congress. The proceeds could fund a new Maritime Security Trust Fund, which was originally proposed in the SHIPs Act. It would provide the dedicated, mandatory funding stream that American shipbuilding has never had. Without that fund, almost everything else in the document is a wish list waiting for annual appropriations that may never come.\n\nThe second major innovation is Maritime Prosperity Zones, 100 designated areas across the coasts, Great Lakes, river systems, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories where tax-advantaged private investment would flow into shipyards, supply chain companies, workforce training, and advanced manufacturing. The model is the Opportunity Zones from the 2017 tax reform. If well-designed, MPZs could redirect private capital into maritime industrial communities the way OZs reshaped real estate investment. If poorly designed, they become a tax shelter with a maritime label. The difference will be in the eligibility criteria and enforcement, neither of which is specified in the MAP, those details are left to the Secretary of Commerce and forthcoming legislation.\n\nThird, the MAP proposes extending the Capital Construction Fund, a proven tax-deferral tool that has helped vessel owners reinvest in new ships for decades, to shipyard owners. With $2.59 billion currently sitting in vessel-owner CCF accounts, this is a mechanism that works. Extending it to yards would let shipyard owners defer earnings into infrastructure, equipment, and modernization. It\u2019s elegant and overdue.\n\nAnd fourth, there\u2019s what the MAP calls the \u201cBridge Strategy\u201d, a concept that solves the chicken-and-egg problem of rebuilding from near zero. Allied shipbuilders would build the first hulls of a multi-vessel contract in their home yards while simultaneously investing capital in U.S. shipyards they\u2019ve purchased or partnered with. Later hulls migrate to American production. On the press call, officials pointed to the Finland icebreaker deal, which brings Finnish shipbuilding expertise to the U.S. for Arctic Security Cutters, as the prototype. If it scales to Korean and Japanese yards, this could be the mechanism that actually gets ships in the water while American capacity ramps up.\n\nThese four tools, the vessel fee, the Trust Fund, the MPZs, and the Bridge Strategy, are the plan\u2019s center of gravity. But the supporting architecture matters too and critics we talked to pointed out that not much progress has been made public after Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, CEO of CMA CGA, offered to invest $20 Billion in US flagged ships. The MAP proposes a new Strategic Commercial Fleet for international trade routes, expanded cargo preference requirements, Title XI loan guarantee reform, and a land port maintenance tax on merchandise entering the United States through land ports of entry. It calls for recapitalizing the U.S. Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore and much needed refurbishment and modernizing the US Merchant Marine Academy, which it describes as requiring urgent attention. It includes an Arctic maritime strategy and frameworks for autonomous vessels, noting, with unusual candor, that no established procedures or protocols exist for verifying AI-driven navigational decisions. As I\u2019ve stated twice already, it\u2019s ambitious.\n\nThe Ready Reserve Fleet gets particular attention. The MAP acknowledges what everyone in the industry knows: the fleet\u2019s vessels are aging, spare parts are increasingly difficult to source, maintenance costs are climbing, and recruiting qualified civilian mariners to crew activated vessels is a persistent challenge. Recapitalizing the RRF will require significant investment, and the MAP doesn\u2019t pretend otherwise.\n\nThe document is comprehensive. But its fate rests on whether the Administration can find money in tarrifs and port fees directly or will have to wait for a lumbering and broken Congress the enact the revenue and incentive mechanisms that make the rest viable.\n\nI\u2019n a White House meeting with senior Administration official this morning aI sked the question that I think matters most for execution: MARAD has roughly 200 people working on policy and is decades behind in publishing their annual review of shipyards. NAVSEA has 83,000. How does this plan get implemented? The officials pointed to new institutional architecture, a shipbuilding office at OMB focused on implementation, a shipbuilding directorate at NSC focused on policy, and Steve Carmel leading a Maritime Administration that the plan calls to fully resource. They described a \u201cwhole-of-government, whole-of-nation\u201d approach where no single agency owns the mission. That\u2019s the right answer in theory. In practice, interagency coordination is where Washington policies go to die, slowly, through turf battles and budget fights that nobody outside the Beltway ever sees.\n\nThe Hard Questions\n\nThe MAP deserves credit for what it gets right. The diagnosis is accurate. The policy toolkit is creative. The people are qualified. But several questions will determine whether this plan joins the long list of ambitious maritime proposals that went nowhere, or becomes the inflection point its authors intend.\n\nThe China contradiction. The MAP\u2019s entire demand-signal architecture depends on generating revunue and making foreign-built ships more expensive to create market space for American-built ones. Yet the most powerful tool for making Chinese-built ships more expensive, the USTR actions, including service fees on foreign-built vehicle carriers and restrictions on certain maritime transport services, is currently suspended. The U.S. and China reached a deal on October 30, 2025, pausing these actions for one year starting November 10, 2025. The administration is simultaneously telling Congress to pass new fees on foreign vessels while pausing existing enforcement against the single largest source of subsidized foreign competition. Mentions of China in the MAP itself are pointed but sparse.\n\nWill allied shipbuilders actually come? The Bridge Strategy and the $150 billion in allied investment secured through trade negotiations depend on foreign shipbuilders, Korean, Japanese, Finnish, possibly Italian, being willing to build capacity inside a competitor nation. The Finland icebreaker deal is one data point. Scaling it requires allied corporations to see strategic benefit in establishing American production lines. What\u2019s in it for Hyundai or Samsung Heavy Industries to help rebuild the shipbuilding capability they currently dominate? Access to U.S. defense contracts is one answer. Tax incentives through MPZs is another. But the question of whether allied capital follows allied rhetoric is one the MAP cannot answer by itself.\n\nWhere do the workers come from? The MAP\u2019s workforce pillar contains two genuinely useful ideas, expanding the Military-to-Mariner pipeline so veterans can convert military sea service to merchant marine credentials, and allowing U.S. mariners on international routes to exclude foreign earned income the way any American working abroad can. Both are overdue and mariners will likely be most excited about the tax breaks. But the binding constraint isn\u2019t training capacity, it\u2019s labor supply competition. Every welder, pipefitter, and electrician who goes to a shipyard is one who doesn\u2019t go to an LNG facility, a semiconductor fab, or a defense plant. In a labor market where every industrial sector in America is competing for the same tradespeople, the MAP\u2019s training proposals are necessary but not sufficient. The shipyard CEOs reading this will notice that gap.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSea power has long been a cornerstone of America\u2019s global leadership, the MAP\u2019s own conclusion says as much, and it\u2019s right. This is the most comprehensive federal maritime policy document since 1936, produced by people who understand both the problem and the politics. The policy toolkit, vessel fees, a Trust Fund, Prosperity Zones, the Bridge Strategy, a Strategic Commercial Fleet, is more creative and more aggressive than anything Washington has proposed for commercial shipbuilding in living memory.\n\nThe plan\u2019s weakness is the same weakness that has killed every previous attempt: the gap between policy ambition and industrial execution. The MAP diagnoses the disease correctly. It prescribes the right medicine. But it doesn\u2019t fill the prescription, that requires Congress, the FY2027 budget, and private capital willing to bet that the demand signals are real and durable.\n\nWhat to watch: the FY2027 budget details, the legislative package timing, the first Maritime Prosperity Zone designations, whether allied investment deals scale beyond Finland, and November 2026, when the China Section 301 suspension expires.\n\nThe MAP is the foundation. The FY2027 budget is the rebar. The legislative package is the concrete. Until all three are in place, this is the best plan American shipbuilding has had in 90 years, and a plan is all it is.\n\n\u201cInvestment in the maritime industrial base by both the U.S. government and the private sector has declined. As a result, American shipbuilding capacity has withered, less than 1% of new commercial ships are built in the United States, and government shipbuilding has suffered,\u201d said Anna Kelly, White House Deputy Press Secretary, in a statement to gCaptain this morning. \u201cPresident Trump is the first president in decades to recognize the critical importance of American maritime dominance, and he has done more than anyone to revitalize this vital sector for our national security.\u201d\n\nBoth these statements are true and this is the frist Administration in recent memory that\u2019s been willing to tell the full unvarnish truth about the decline of shipbuilding and the US Merchant Marine but have they bitten off more than out nation can chew? I sincerly hope not.",

While the ECAs are important in terms of reducing SOx and NOx air pollution, they do not adequately reduce emissions of superpollutant black carbon which poses both a health and a climate risk in the Arctic.\u201d\n\nLast October, the Nordic Council recommended that Nordic Governments take action to require that theses cleaner \u201cpolar\u201d fuels be used in the Arctic, but so far, Denmark and Greenland are the only Nordic nations to co-sponsor the proposal for an Arctic fuel measure.\n\nCanada\n\nThe Nordic Council Recommendation does not address Canada, but as an Arctic nation, Canada\u2019s support is equally necessary to reduce air pollution and the impact of Black Carbon on sea ice.\n\n\u201cCanada has supported the need for regulating Black Carbon from shipping for many years at the IMO, and also in domestic climate and air pollution strategies\u201d, said Andrew Dumbrille, Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance and Director of Equal Routes, a Clean Arctic Alliance member. \u201cPPR 13 is a prime opportunity to put this into action. For the first time a globally binding measure can be developed which will clean the air for Indigenous and local communities, contribute to maintaining ice habitat for wildlife, safeguard harvest rights key for local food sovereignty, and urgently address the climate crisis in the Arctic.\u201d\n\nIceland\n\nIn recent weeks, months and years, Iceland has repeatedly declared its support for Greenland\u2019s rights for full sovereignty; rights which are threatened by the rapid loss of ice and glaciers in the Arctic.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that Iceland support this proposal from Denmark, Greenland and others which with a wide scope can improve air quality in Iceland\u2019s waters and reduce black carbon emissions originating within Iceland\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) from settling onto sea- and land-ice in the Arctic \u2013 this pollution is speeding up melting, which in turn is contributing to the slowing down of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\u201d, said Arni Finnsson, Board Chair at the Iceland Nature Conservation Association.\n\nNote: Iceland deems possible Atlantic current collapse a security risk (Reuters)\n\nNorway\n\n\u201cNorway has already introduced an Emission Control Area in the Norwegian Sea which will take effect from 1 March 2027, and has supported the adoption of the Nordic Council Recommendation on action by Nordic Governments on the use of polar fuels in the Arctic\u201d, said Karoline Andaur, CEO of WWF Norway (WWF Verdens naturfond). \u201cNorway should support the proposal from Denmark, Greenland and others which with a wide scope can improve air quality in Norwegian waters, reduce black carbon emissions originating within Norway\u2019s EEZ settling onto sea- and land-ice in the Arctic, and reduce the threat of heavy fuel oil spills.\u201d\n\nSource: Clean Arctic Alliance",
