            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">Does being listed here mean my ship is inefficient or badly operated?</p>
                <p>
                    No. Ships on this website are typically ranked by <strong>absolute CO2 emissions</strong>.
                    High absolute emissions do not imply inefficiency, poor operation, or non-compliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Large vessels, ships with high utilisation, and vessels operating long or frequent routes
                    will naturally emit more CO2 than smaller or less active ships.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">Why does this site call ships "dirtiest"?</p>
                <p>
                    The term "dirtiest" is used to draw attention to <strong>total CO2 contribution</strong>,
                    not to make moral or technical judgements about individual ships, crews, or operators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It reflects climate impact in absolute terms, not performance per tonne, mile, or passenger.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">Is this data reliable?</p>
                <p>
                    The data originates from the <strong>EU Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV)</strong>
                    system, which requires ship operators to submit annual emissions reports that are
                    independently verified by accredited third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DirtiestShips.com republishes this data as reported and does not alter official figures.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">Does this include all greenhouse gas emissions?</p>
                <p>
                    No. The data includes <strong>tank-to-wake CO2 emissions only</strong>, as defined under EU MRV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It does not include methane, nitrous oxide, or upstream emissions from fuel production
                    (well-to-tank).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">Why isn't emissions data normalised per tonne-mile or passenger?</p>
                <p>
                    Normalised metrics require additional operational data (cargo carried, distance,
                    passenger numbers) that is not consistently or publicly available at ship level
                    under EU MRV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where such metrics are shown, they are clearly labelled. Otherwise, rankings are
                    based on absolute emissions only.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">Can I compare different ship types directly?</p>
                <p>
                    No. Direct comparisons between different vessel types (e.g. ferries, tankers,
                    bulk carriers, container ships) are not analytically meaningful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users should always compare ships within similar vessel types and size categories.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">Does this mean my ship is non-compliant with regulations?</p>
                <p>
                    No. Inclusion on this website does not indicate regulatory non-compliance.
                    All ships listed have reported emissions as required under EU MRV regulations.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">Are charterers or operators identified?</p>
                <p>
                    Where available, company names are shown as reported in EU MRV data.
                    This does not imply responsibility, fault, or operational control for emissions outcomes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">What about speed, weather, or routing constraints?</p>
                <p>
                    Emissions figures do not adjust for weather conditions, routing limitations,
                    port congestion, or commercial speed requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These factors can significantly influence fuel consumption and emissions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="question">Can I request corrections or clarifications?</p>
                <p>
                    Yes. If you believe vessel data has been misclassified or incorrectly displayed,
                    please contact us with supporting information. We will review all substantiated requests.
